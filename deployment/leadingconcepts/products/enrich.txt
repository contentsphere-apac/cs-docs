Enriching Product Information

Why do we enrich product information
=====================================

Having a product that is described by text-heavy information, more often than not, overwhelms a potential customer.
Going through chunks of text to know about the product doesn't appeal to a majority of consumers simply because they don't spend time and effort to peruse all that text.
On the other hand, a product that is enriched with visuals is more appreciated since it gives the customer an at-a-glance feel for the product before they delve into the details.

A product can be enriched by adding digital assets such as relevant images and videos to the product information page.
With the inclusion of images and videos to the product information page, the customer can gain a better understanding about the product through the informative visuals presented alongside the text content.
These images can range from the different views of the products, down to its multiple variants and customizations.

It is for this reason that we use Digital Asset Management (DAM), a solution for enterprises to store, organize, find and retrieve digital files.
Digital files in the DAM are linked to the PIM through relationships.
