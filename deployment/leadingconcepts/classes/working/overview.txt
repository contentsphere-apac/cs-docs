What is a Class?
==================

A class is a blueprint, a detailed description, a definition of the object. It describes the attributes,
characteristics and behavior that you use to create any type of object. For example, you want to
build a house, then you first make its blueprint. The blueprint of a house describes everything about
how that house will be built. You can use this blueprint to build one, two, or hundred houses. In the same manner,
you define the blueprint of any object in the class, and then using that class you can create N
number of objects of that class.

Each class can be categorized either as: Nature Class or Non-Nature Class

Nature Class
--------------

We can define a base type of product using Nature class. Here, we can define behavior of a product. It
helps to define how a product should look like.


Attribution or Non-Nature Class
---------------------------------

There are two ways to enrich the product details; one way is to add taxonomies to a product and the
other way is to add Non-Nature class to a product. So, defining a Non-Nature class is one of the ways
to enrich the product. We can define additional attributes in a non-nature class and tag this non-
nature class to a product. This will specify further additional details regarding the product.
