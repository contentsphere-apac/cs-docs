Dependent Attributes
=====================


Dependent attribute is a grouping of commonly shared attributes and tags attached to the main product.
A dependent attribute is also referred to as *Minor taxonomy*. One could create a minor taxonomy say for a *Wood type (Teak, Plywood)* and apply it to the main product *(Dining Table)*.

	**Example:**

	There are properties that are dependent on the type of material.
	Glass has different properties associated with it and steel has different properties as well.
	The *‘Material’* will be set as a minor taxonomy and will be added in a property collection.
