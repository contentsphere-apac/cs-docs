===========

Templates provide the facility used in defining how a default view should look like for a specific role in an organization. It allows you to define its property collections, relationships, contexts, and nature relationships. This template will be assigned to a specific role and that role will have the property collections, relationships, contexts, and nature relationships defined in a template by default.
In other words, a template defines default behavior of a role of an organization.
