What is a Tab
===============

For a better distribution of content and a clutter-free display, one could divide the product information into various tabs.
The tabs may contain one or many property collections added to it. Relevant tabs make navigation easy and give the product its desired structure.
Once the content behind each tab is logically chunked, the users can easily predict what they'll find when they select a certain tab.

  **Example:**

  Mobile Product information can be divided into several tabs â€“ Overview (that displays information like classes, Taxonomies, Versions),
  Property Collection (that displays information like Brand Name, PID, Short and Long Description and so on), and Relationships (that displays related Images, Market, Video, and so on).
