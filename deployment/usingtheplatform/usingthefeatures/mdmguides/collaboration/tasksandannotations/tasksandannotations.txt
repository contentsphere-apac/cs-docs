**Key Term:**           * **Product Information Management (PIM):** facilitates the central management and maintenance of an enterpriseâ€™s product data, content or any related information.

**Description:**        * Tasks are action events created for an article. These tasks are intended for a user, and in the system, the tasks contain a description of what action should be done.
                        * The Tasks feature has a comment section where users can put comments or questions regarding the task.
                        * The Tasks feature also helps a user schedule different actions in the system.

**Application:**        * Tasks are created for action events related to articles or assets in the system.  These tasks can be for any event dedicated to any user.
                        * Tasks allow comments or notes from other users that will give more information on the action needed.
                        * *Example:*

                            A task is created to check the details of an article. The task is called **Check Data in Product**.
                            The task can have a note from a different user saying *"Check the properties like Display and Pricing Details"*.
