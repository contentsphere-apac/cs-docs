Archival and Restoration
=========================
The Archival and Restoration is a feature that enables restoration of archived products so as to make them available when needed.


===================     =======================================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term:**           * **Archival:** is the process of removing a product from the PIM and moving it into a separate storage area (archive).
                          This process will not delete the product.
                        * **Restoration:** is the action of returning products from the archive to its previous location in the PIM.

**Description:**        * The Archival and Restoration feature is concerned with managing the archived products.
                        * This feature allows the user to restore and reuse the products that have been archived.

**Application:**        * The products that have reached their end of life can be removed from the PIM while still keeping them on record.
                        * Archived products can be retrieved whenever needed.
                        * *Example:*

                            An electronics retailer wants to remove an old iPhone version from their PIM and replace it with the latest model.
                            The retailer archives the older version so that it is no longer available in the PIM.
                            The older version of the product can be restored when the needed arises.
