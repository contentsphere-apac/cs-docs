Information

The Information Dashboard provides the users with several widgets to gain a high level overview of the system.

The products with Red violations can’t be pushed into the PIM portal. It is also possible to rectify the product data by clicking on each chart.

On the lower part of the screen, widgets for *'Recently Updated'* and *'Recently Added'* contents are visible.
