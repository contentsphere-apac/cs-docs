**Key Term:**           * **Endpoint:** a gateway that describes the system, processes and mapping to be used when onboarding or offboarding the products to and from the system.

**Description:**        * This feature is used to update or to create products by a supplier.
                        * This import file feature is done through a **talend job**. Note that before the creation of an on-boarding type process, it is needed to configure the talend job.
                        * To update or create products, supplier sends the JSON file through *JMS (Java Message Services)* queue.  This queue is used by suppliers to view the order of on-boarding jobs.
                        * The JSON file is structured that it should contain: **Main Class ID, Product ID,** and all the **Property Collection-related class**.

                        * *Example:*

                            Supplier A wants to change the selling price of the beverage, *Red Bull*. He can do so by creating a JSON file and mentioning the updated price.
