Release notes
=============

Release notes for the official Django releases. Each release note will tell you
what's new in each version, and will also describe any backwards-incompatible
changes made in that version.

For those :doc:`upgrading to a new version of Contentsphere</how/upgrade version>`,
you will need to check all the backwards-incompatible changes and
:doc:`deprecated features</feature/deprecation>` for each 'final' release
from the one after your current Django version, up to and including the new
version.

Final releases
