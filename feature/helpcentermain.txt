Using this Resource
====================

The Help Center holds everything you need to know about the **Contentserv** application suite in the form of
training materials and guides.

To search through the documentation see the :ref:`search` or use the search field in the navigation bar.

The site is organized into four key areas which are referenced throughout the handbook. The Handbook is also
the basis for the context sensitive help and tooltips within the application.

* :doc:`Tutorials </deployment/usingtheplatform/usingthefeatures/tutorials/index>` take you by the hand through a series of steps to work within the **Contentserv** application.
  Start here if you’re new to **Contentserv** or training on the product as a user.
  Also look at the *New to Contentserv* section below.

* :doc:`Feature guides </deployment/usingtheplatform/usingthefeatures/index>` discuss key features and concepts at a fairly high level and provide
  useful background information and explanation, including key user stories.

* :doc:`Reference guides </reference/index>` contain technical reference for implementation and support of the
  application and other aspects of **Contentserv’s** machinery. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume
  that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.

* :doc:`Glossary </glossary>` defines the terms found in Contentserv.
