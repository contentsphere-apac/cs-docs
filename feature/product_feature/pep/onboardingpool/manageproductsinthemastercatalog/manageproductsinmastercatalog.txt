Manage Products in the Master Catalog
======================================
The Manage Products in the Master Catalog is a feature that allows a Data Steward to add information to the products so that the products have complete definitions.


===================     =======================================================================================================================================================================
**Description:**        * Master Catalog allows a Data Steward to manage all products at the time of onboarding.
                        * The feature also allows a Data Steward to manage all the content and data of a product before transferring it to PIM.

**Application:**        * The Master Catalog feature can permit users to manage all of the product content.
                        * *Example:*

                            An organization has a Data Steward who manages all the products in the Master Catalog and there are *Suppliers A and B*, who sell furniture and fashion products.
                            Data Steward gives permission for *Data Integration* to both suppliers.
                            They proceeded with the onboarding of their products and transferring to the Master Catalog,
                            where all the Products are verified and corrected by the Data Steward, if necessary.
