Manage Product Definitions across Systems
==========================================
The Manage Product Definitions across Systems feature is a feature that allows a user to see all of the products in the Master Catalog and to have a consolidated view of product definitions across *Systems*.


===================     =======================================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term:**           * **Product Information Management (PIM):** facilitates the central management and maintenance of an enterpriseâ€™s product data, content or any related information.

**Description:**        * Master Catalog allows a user to manage all products at the time of onboarding.
                        * The feature manages all the content of the product before transferring to PIM, and allows the user to make changes in the product content.

**Application:**        * Master catalog allows the user to manage all the product content.
                        * *Example:*

                            A retailer, with 5 suppliers, creates a user who monitors the data quality of products that are onboarded.
                            The user allows the suppliers to import their products via *Data Integration* and once the data quality check is passed and completed,
                            the user will push the products to PIM. These products will now be visible in the Master Catalog.
