**Description:**        * Outbound Endpoint allows users to make a data endpoint where the data would be transferred from the system to an export functionality, example, an Excel file.
                        * In *Outbound Endpoint*, an endpoint can have only one process.

**Related topics:**     * *Products*

**Application:**        * To create data endpoints, admin decides on the process that would be off-board.
                        * *Example:*

                            *Organization A* sells electronics. If a user from Organization A wants to transfer product data from the system to the sheet, the user can make an endpoint and selects that endpoint at the time of off-board.
