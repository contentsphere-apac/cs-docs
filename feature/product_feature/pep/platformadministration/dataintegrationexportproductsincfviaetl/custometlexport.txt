**Key Term:**            **endpoint:** *(concept)* Gateway that describes the system, processes and mapping to be used when onboarding or offboarding the products to and from the system.

**Description:**        * This feature is used for any modification of a product and also used to save product on the supplier side.
                        * This feature will provide JSON message of the modified product to any ERP system or any downstream system to update the other parties using the product.
                          The details will enter the retailer's system in *JSON format* and can be viewed in queue section with the destination queue name.
                        * The queue will be used by a retailer to read or use the modified information about the product. This information (JSON content) is only visible to the target retailer.
