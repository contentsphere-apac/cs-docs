**Key Term:**            * **DAM:** Digital Asset Management (DAM) offers a solution for enterprises to store, organize, find and retrieve digital files. Digital files in the DAM are linked to the PIM through relationships.
**Description:**        * The admin can set up the data model like *Attributes, Tags, Classes,* etc. in various languages so that it can be understood by users in multiple countries or regions.
                        * It is important for a retailer to have different language data models and products/articles.

                            all the product and website information in French. Even the data model items like Short Description will be displayed in French: Brève Description.
