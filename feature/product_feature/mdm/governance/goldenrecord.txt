Golden Record
==============
The Golden Record is a feature that sets up matching rules to identify multiple supplier records for the same article;
it also sets up merging rules to consolidate information and to facilitate the best merging of content.


====================      ===============================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term:**             * **Golden Record:** is a single, well-defined version of a data entity in an organization. There may be multiple sources and suppliers for a single product and
                            the Golden Record feature allows the combination and consolidation of all matching products (duplicate products) in one single record.
                            With the Golden Record, you will always have exact and consistent product data that are available.
                            Golden Record uses matching and merging rules to consolidate the product details.

                          * **Match:** is the process of identifying duplicate records of all products.
                            It compares products based on defined *attributes, tags, taxonomies, and classes* and by this comparison, identifies the duplicate records.

                          * **Merge:** is the process of consolidating data from identified duplicate records to create a Golden Record.
                            This is the best record with the current, complete, and accurate details of product information.
                            The merging process determines the data elements and values from duplicates that are considered in creating the Golden Record.

**Description:**          * Golden Record is concerned with creating a single view of the master data.
                          * This feature provides out-of-the-box cleansing, verifying, matching, merging, and de-duplication mechanism of data.

                          * :doc:`Standardization and Normalization </feature/product_feature/mdm/governance/standardizationandnormalization/index>`

**Application:**          * *Example:*

                                Multiple duplicate records are available in the system for a single product.
                                These records come from two different sources. The records contain details such as: *Name, GTIN, Description, and Price* of a product.
                                All the details provided by one source is accurate except for the description of the product.
                                The **Golden Record** feature will allow the creation of a single product, which will have the *Name, GTIN, and Price* details from one source
                                and it can fetch and display the correct *Description* from the other source.
                                Now, all the duplicate records will be eliminated and a single record will be there for that product.
                                This record will contain the accurate data and up-to-date information of the product.

|


#. Go to *Data Governance*. Click on the **Golden Record Rules**.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_gotodatagovernance.PNG
|
|


#. Click on the "+" icon to create a *Golden Record rule*.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_clickontheicon.PNG
|
|


#. Provide a name for the *rule* and select the *Nature Class*, where the rule will be applied.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_namethegoldenrecordrule.PNG
|
|


#. Once the details are provided, click on the **Create** button.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_oncethedetailsareprovided.PNG
|
|


#. Once clicked, a Golden Record Rule window will load. Provide the details for the following: *Partners and Physical Catalog*.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_onceclickedagoldenrecordrule.PNG
|
|


#. Then, complete the details under the **Match** section: *Tags, Attributes, Nature Class, Non-Nature Class, and Taxonomies*.
   As mentioned in the description, the details to be provided in these fields will be used to compare records and to classify them as duplicates.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_thencompletethedetails.PNG
|
|


#. For the **Merge** section, define the *Attributes, Tags, Relationships, and Nature Relationships*.
   When you define these parameters, the default value gets reflected for the defined attribute, tag, relationship, or nature relationship while merging
   (though one can override the values in the merging process).

|


#. Click on the "+" icon and then, select the attributes from the menu. Click the **Apply** button.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_clickontheiconandthenselectattributes2.PNG
|
|


#. Once the **Apply** button is clicked, a new window will open.  Notice that the *Latest* radio button is turned on, by default.
   This means that the system will consider the value of the latest record from the duplicate records for the selected/defined attribute.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_oncetheapplybutton.PNG
|
|


#. Similarly for the *Supplier*, click on the "+" icon to define this attribute. Then, select a supplier from the list and click the **Apply** button.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_similarlyforthesupplier.PNG
|
|


#. Repeat the steps for the *Tags, Relationships, and Nature Relationships*.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_repeatthesteps.PNG
|
|


#. Once completed, click the **Ok** button.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_oncecompletedclicktheokbutton.PNG
|
|


#. Click on the **Explore** button and go to *PIM* to view the products.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_clicktheexplorebutton.PNG
|
|


#. To test the feature, create a new *Nature Class* (as defined in the *Match* section).
   Do this by placing the cursor over the "+" icon in PIM and selecting the Nature Class defined in the Golden Record rule.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_totestthefeature.PNG
|
|


#. Create the product and provide details like the values of *Properties, Relationships, Classes, and Taxonomies*.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_createtheproductandprovide.PNG
|
|


#. Repeat the steps to create as many duplicates, as desired using the defined nature class.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_repeatthestepstocreateasmany.PNG
|
|


*Note: Once there are duplicates, whose attributes are monitored by the Golden Record rule, the system will compare the provided details of each product (Tags, Attributes, Nature Class, Non-Nature Class, and Taxonomies) to find these duplicates.
Once found, the system will put these records in a bundle and will create a bucket.*

|
|


#. To view this bucket, go to the *Dashboard* and click on the **Buckets** tab. View the *Properties* and *Matches* of the set Golden Record rule.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_toviewthisbucket.PNG
|
|


#. Click the icon found on the upper right corner of the Golden Record rule entry.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_clickontheiconontheupperright.PNG
|
|


#. View the duplicate records as they are presented in a table. Each duplicate is shown in one column.
   Each column will also display the value of the *Tags, Attributes, Nature Class, Non-Nature Class, Taxonomies, and Relationships* applied to each record.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_viewtheduplicaterecords.PNG
|
|


#. Select one from the values of all the shown *Tags, Attributes, Nature Class, Non-Nature Class, Taxonomies, and Relationships*.
   All the selected values will be displayed in a final product when we merge the records into a single record.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_selectoneofthevalues.PNG
|
|


#. Note that there is a symbol beside each value.  An equal sign means that this value is equal to the value in the merged record.
   Make sure that all values you want to include in the Golden Record have this symbol.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_notethattherearesymbols.PNG
|
|


#. Once all the values are added and completed, click on the **Create** button. This will then merge all the duplicates into a single record.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_onceallthevaluesareadded.PNG
|
|


#. Go to *PIM* and find the merged record. To locate it, look for the **Crown** symbol on the lower right.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_gotopimandfindtherecord.PNG
|
|


#. Click on the **Golden Record** and go to the *Source* tab to view the list of the duplicate records that have been used and merged into one *Golden Record*.
