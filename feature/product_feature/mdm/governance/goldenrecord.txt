Golden Record
==============
The Golden Record is a feature that sets up matching rules to consolidate multiple supplier records for the same article.
It also sets up merging rules to facilitate the best merging of content.


====================      ===============================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term:**             * **Golden Record:** is a single, well-defined version of a data entity in an organization. There may be multiple sources and suppliers for a single product and
                            the Golden Record feature allows the combination and consolidation of all matching products (duplicate products) in one single record.
                            With the Golden Record, you will always have exact and consistent product data that are available.
                            Golden Record uses matching and merging rules to consolidate the product details.

                          * **Match:** is the process of identifying duplicate records of all products.
                            It compares products based on defined *attributes, tags, taxonomies, and classes* and by the comparison, identifies duplicate records of a product.

                          * **Merge:** is the process of consolidating data from identified duplicate records to create a Golden Record.
                            This is the best record of the current, complete, and accurate view of product information.
                            The merging process determines what data elements and their corresponding values from duplicated data need to be considered to create the Golden Record.

**Description:**          * Golden Record is concerned with creating a single view of the master data.
                          * This feature provides out-of-the-box cleansing, verifying, matching, merging, and de-duplication mechanism of data.

                          * :doc:`Standardization and Normalization </feature/product_feature/mdm/governance/standardizationandnormalization/index>`

**Application:**          * *Example:*

                                Two duplicate records are available in the system for a single product.
                                These records come from two different sources. The records contain details such as: *Name, GTIN, Description, and Price* of a product.
                                All the details provided by one source is accurate except for the description of the product.
                                The **Golden Record** feature will allow the creation of a single product, which will have the *Name, GTIN, and Price* details from one source
                                and it can fetch and display the correct *Description* from the other source.
                                Now, all the duplicate records will be eliminated and a single record will be there for a single product.
                                This record will contain the accurate data related to that product.

|
|


#. Then, complete the details under the **Match** section: *Tags, Attributes, Nature Class, Non-Nature Class, and Taxonomies*.
   As mentioned in the description, the details to be provided in these fields will be used to compare records and to match for duplicates.

|
|


#. For the **Merge** section, define the *Attributes, Tags, Relationships, and Nature Relationships*.
   When you define these parameters, the default value gets reflected for the defined attribute, tag, relationship, or nature relationship while merging
   (though one can override the values in the merging process).

|
|


#. Once the **Apply** button is clicked, a new window will open.  Notice that the *Latest* radio button is turned on, by default.
   This means that the system will consider the value of the latest record from the duplicate records for the selected/defined attribute.

#. To test the feature, create a new *Nature Class* (as defined in the *Match* section).
   Do this by placing the cursor over the "+" icon in PIM and selecting the Nature Class defined in the Golden Record rule.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_totestthefeature.PNG

#. Repeat the steps to create as many products as desired using the defined nature class.

*Note: Once there are duplicates in the system whose attributes correspond to the Golden Record rule, the system will compare the provided details of each product (Tags, Attributes, Nature Class, Non-Nature Class, and Taxonomies) to find these duplicates.
Once found, the system will put these records in a bundle and will create a bucket of the product.

|
|

#. To view this bucket, go to the *Dashboard* and click on the **Buckets** tab. View the *Properties* and *Matches* of the set Golden Record rule.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_toviewthisbucket.PNG
|
|

#. Click on the icon on the upper right corner of the Golden Record rule entry.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_clickontheiconontheupperright.PNG
|
|


#. View the duplicate records as the records are presented in a table. Each duplicate is shown in one column.
   Each column will also display the value of the *Tags, Attributes, Nature Class, Non-Nature Class, Taxonomies, and Relationships* applied to each record.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_viewtheduplicaterecords.PNG
|
|


#. Select one from the values of all the shown *Tags, Attributes, Nature Class, Non-Nature Class, Taxonomies, and Relationships*.
   All the selected values will be displayed in a final product when we merge the records into a single record.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_selectoneofthevalues.PNG

|


#. Note that there are symbols beside each value.  An equal sign symbol means that this value will be used in the merged record.
   Make sure that all values you want to include in the merged record have this symbol.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_notethattherearesymbols.PNG
|

#. Once all the values are added and completed, click on the **Create** button. This will then merge all the duplicates into a single record.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_onceallthevaluesareadded.PNG
|

#. Go to *PIM* and find the merged record. To locate it, look for the **Crown** symbol on the lower right.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_goldenrecord_gotopimandfindtherecord.PNG
