==============
The Golden Record is a feature that sets up matching rules to consolidate multiple supplier records for the same article.
It also sets up merging rules to facilitate the best merging of content.

**Key Term:**             * **Golden Record:** is a single, well-defined version of a data entity in an organization. There may be multiple sources and suppliers for a single product and
                            the Golden Record feature allows the combination and consolidation of all matching products (duplicate products) in one single record.
                            With the Golden Record, you will always have exact and consistent product data that are available.
                            Golden Record uses matching and merging rules to consolidate the product details.

                          * **Match:** is the process of identifying duplicate records of all products.
                            It compares products based on defined *attributes, tags, taxonomies, and classes* and by the comparison, identifies duplicate records of a product.

                          * **Merge:** is the process of consolidating data from identified duplicate records to create a Golden Record.
                            This is the best record of the current, complete, and accurate view of product information.
                            The merging process determines what data elements and their corresponding values from duplicated data need to be considered to create the Golden Record.

**Description:**          * Golden Record is concerned with creating a single view of the master data.
                          * This feature provides out-of-the-box cleansing, verifying, matching, merging, and de-duplication mechanism of data.

**Application:**          * *Example:*

                                Two duplicate records are available in the system for a single product.
                                These details come from two different sources. The records contain the details like name, GTIN, description, and price of a product.
                                Now, all the details provided by one source is accurate except the description of the product.
                                Golden Record feature will allow to create a single product which will have all the details like name, GTIN, and price from one source
                                and it can fetch and display the description from the other source.
                                Now, all the duplicate records will be eliminated and a single record will be there for a single product.
                                This record will contain the accurate data related to products.
