KPI-based Conformity Rules
===========================
The KPI-based Conformity Rules is a data governance feature that sets up rules to assess the conformance of an *Article* or a *Product* to the acceptable standards.


===================     =======================================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term:**           * **Key Performance Indicator (KPI):** is a measurement used to determine the quality of product data added into the system in relation to a set standard.

**Description:**        * KPIs help to find the accuracy of the products on the basis of an article's attributes, taxonomy, and tags.
                        * KPIs check the following 4 factors: *Completeness, Conformity, Uniqueness, and Accuracy.*
                        * KPIs drill down on the basis of *Taxonomy* and *Tags*.
                        * The KPI: **Conformity** checks the accuracy of data in the product and also inspects the data compliance with respect to the standards.

**Application:**        * **Data Conformity** is one of the most important data quality and accuracy checking characteristics. It is a very important factor for KPIs.
                        * *Example:*

                            An organization sells furniture products. They have attributes for *Length of the wood* and tags for *Color*.
                            Then, the *Conformity Rule* helps users to check that the length should not be more than 400m (40,000cm).
