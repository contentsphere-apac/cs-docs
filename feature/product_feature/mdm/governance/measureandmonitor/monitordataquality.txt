**Application:**        * Dashboards often provide at-a-glance views of KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) relevant to a particular objective or business process.
                        * These reports help a user understand the products in the system and if there are any errors in them.
                          Also, a user has presented a precise and accurate view of the data in the system with respect to Data Quality.
                        * A user can see all the set rules together in a single graph.
                        * *Example:*

                            Supplier A has about 1000 products in the system and few of them have incomplete data.
                            The supplier will be able to track the same with the help of graphs on the Dashboard and can properly take corrective actions.
