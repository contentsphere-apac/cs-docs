Manage Role Access to Class and Taxonomies
===========================================
The Manage Role Access to Class and Taxonomies feature is an admin feature that restricts a role's access to *Class and Taxonomy levels*
so that the users can work directly with the articles they are intended to be responsible for.


===================     =======================================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term**            * **Class**: a class defines the base configuration for products.
                        * **Taxonomy**: a taxonomy is a scheme of classification used for an organizationâ€™s products.

**Description:**        * This feature is particularly helpful in an organization that has various users like *Supplier(s)/Partner(s), Asset Manager, Data Stewards, Admin* etc.
                        * This feature allows the admin to restrict a user to access or view products in PIM.

**Related topics:**     * :doc:`Manage Permissions </feature/product_feature/mdm/administration/usersandpermissionscrudrights/managepermissions>`
                        * :doc:`Manage View Templates </feature/product_feature/mdm/administration/usersandpermissionsviewtemplates/manageviewtemplates`
                        * :doc:`Multi-classify Objects </feature/product_feature/mdm/general/multiclassifcation/multiclassify>`

**Application:**        * Admin has the functionality to restrict the rights of various organization roles (*Admin, Data Stewards, Multiple Suppliers, etc*)
                          so that the roles can have access or view to their respective products in PIM.
                        * *Example:*

                            *Retailer XYZ* has *Supplier A* and *Supplier B*. *Supplier A* provides furniture and *Supplier B* provides electronic goods.
                            So, when restricted by admin, *Supplier A* will only see his products: **Furniture**.
                            Similarly, *Supplier B* will only be able to access his products: **Electronics**.
