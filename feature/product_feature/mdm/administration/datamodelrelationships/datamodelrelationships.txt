**Key Term**              * **Relationships**: a way of linking entities together from different domains (e.g. PIM, MDM, DAM) as well as within the same domain.

**Description:**          * A user can set up relationships between a *Product* and an *Asset.*
                          * A user can set up relationships between *Articles.*
                          * A user can set up relationships between *Entities.*
                          * This feature provides the functionality that allows the linking of a product to its supporting details and assets like a product to its marketing images.
                            This also allows the linking of additional information about the images associated with the products, markets, etc.
                          * This feature provides the functionality that creates relationships which will relate *Products* to the *Markets, Suppliers, Images, Videos, etc*.
                          * This feature provides the functionality that creates relationships that can be bi-directional in which the product can be related to the
                            image/market/supplier and the product will be visible in the image/market/supplier modules.
                          * *Example:*

                             A product is linked to a particular supplier. In the supplier module, the supplier can view all the products that he had supplied.

**Application:**          * Define Article Links feature will link rich content to the products like adding multiple images, videos, PDFs, or even the market
                            that the products are available in.
                          * Define Article Links feature will create relationships that show the way two or more entities are connected or their state of being connected.
                          * Define Article Links feature will create bi-directional relationships. This means that the linking of products to different modules can be seen
                            if you enter either one of the module entities.
                          * Define Article Links feature will create relationships that can *cross-sell* products. An administrator can define a
                            relationship between two products that will prompt the system to suggest related products if a customer buys one of the linked products.
                          * *Example:*

                             In a product-to-product relationship, a link is created between a movie product and a soundtrack product. Once related,
                             if a user buys a movie, the system will be able to offer the soundtrack of that movie to the user, as well.
