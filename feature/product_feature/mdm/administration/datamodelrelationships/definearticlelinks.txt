Define Article Links
=====================
The Define Article Links feature provides the functionality to set up relationships between articles.
The linking between article-to-article or product-to-product is bi-directional.


====================      ===============================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term:**             * **Tabs**: Tabs are used to categorize the properties shown on a productâ€™s page.

**Description:**          * This feature allows the linking of a product to other different products (e.g. *Related Products, others,* etc).
                            The related products will be visible in the product relationship side. The product is visible in the relationship tab of the related products, too.

                          * :doc:`Define Relationships </feature/product_feature/mdm/administration/datamodelrelationships/definerelationships>`

**Application:**          * Define Article Links will allow a product to be linked to similar products in the system.
                            By setting relationships between products, an administrator can set *Related Products* for a product.
                          * *Example:*

                             An electronic product can be linked to its accessories that have also been added in the system by using this feature.
