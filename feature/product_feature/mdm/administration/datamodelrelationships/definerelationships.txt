Define Relationships
=====================
The Define Relationships feature provides the functionality to set up relationships between entities.


====================      ===============================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term:**             * **Classes**: Classes define base configurations for products. Each class that is given to a product allows that product to have a more precise definition.
                            There are multiple levels of classes that can be used in conjunction

                            * *Example:*

                                    Product, Single Article

**Description:**          * This feature links two objects or entities in the system. An example of this linking is the relationship set for an *Article* to its target *Market*
                            or a *Market* to an active *Promotion*.

                          * :doc:`Define Article Links </feature/product_feature/mdm/administration/datamodelrelationships/definearticlelinks>`

**Application:**          * The Define Relationships will allow an administrator to link an article or a product to its target market, which can be a location or a group of
                            consumers that article/product is intended for.
