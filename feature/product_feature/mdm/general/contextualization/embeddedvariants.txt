Embedded Variants within Contexts
=================================
Embedded Variants within Context is a feature that allows users to create a variant embedded within a product. The variant is only applicable within the context of that product.


===================    =============================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term:**          * **Linked Variant:** a variant which belongs to a Product.

**Description:**       * Embedded Variants enable the user to create variants for a product in terms of a context.
                       * A product can have several variants, and these variants can be distinguished based on a context.

**Related topics:**    * :doc:`Target and Channel Contextualization </feature/product_feature/mdm/general/contextualization/targetandchannel>`

**Application:**       * A product can have a number of variants with the master product representing the group of products.
                       * *Example:*

                            A fruit juice can be available in various packaging variants such as single, pack of 4 or pack of 6.
                            In this example, the packaging is a context of the type tag based on which the product is having its variants.
