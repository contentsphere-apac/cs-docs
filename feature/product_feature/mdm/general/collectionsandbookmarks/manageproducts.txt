**Key Term:**           * **Product Information Management (PIM):** facilitates the central management and maintenance of an enterpriseâ€™s product data, content or any related information.

**Description:**        * Collections are created to store a group of products based on their relevance to a user.
                        * Collections can have their own hierarchy and the products in the collection can belong to these hierarchies.
                        * With the use of collections, a group of products can be classified easily.

**Application:**        * Collections make it easy to group relevant products and place them in hierarchies.
                        * *Example:*

                            A collection can be made for a few furniture products and in the collection, hierarchies can be made based on the class type.
