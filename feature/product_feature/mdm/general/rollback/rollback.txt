**Application:**          * The Rollback feature is used to switch back to a desired version of a product.
                            This feature is particularly helpful to revert to a previous version if there are any errors made in any property of the product.
                          * *Example:*

                              Supplier can add commercial text in the 'description' for Toblerone Chocolates during Holiday season.
                              Once the season is over, he can rollback to the  original description version.
