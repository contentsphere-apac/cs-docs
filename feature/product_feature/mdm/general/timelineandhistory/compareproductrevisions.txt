**Key Term:**            * **Attribute:** A data field which describes a product, can also use *'property'*.


**Description:**        * This feature allows a user to compare versions of a product/article.
                        * This feature gives an overview of the similarities and differences of comparable versions and merge values from any previous version to the newer version.
                        * This feature creates a comparison table that shows columns for the product versions and rows for the attributes.  This table allows quick and easy
                          comparison between each offering's features and characteristics.

**Application:**        * A user can track all the changes that are made to a product/article. Based on values, a user can merge a value from a previous version to the newer one.
                        * *Example:*

                            A Red Bull product is created with no short description. Later on, the user adds a description to the product.  When he saves the product
                            with the new description, a version is created. In the timeline, the user can compare these versions and track the changes.
