Manage Taxonomy
===============
Manage Taxonomy lets you add taxonomies to easily classify the products.


====================    =============================================================================================================================================================
**Description:**        * Classification of different objects is made possible by managing taxonomies.
                        * This feature is about mapping an object to various concepts.
                        * Taxonomies can represent related concepts that can be used to connect a product
                          to different levels of taxonomy branches.

**Related topics:**     * *Multi-Taxonomy Assignment*
                        * *Product Classification via Taxonomies*

**Application:**        * Multi-classify objects.
                        * Drive information through the applied taxonomy.
                        * Give the object a hierarchy to show all related contents.
                        * *Example:*

                            Take for instance an electronics retailer who sells all kinds of electronics and wants to classify his products.
                            The mobile phones that he sells will have a taxonomy "Electronics" and under electronics, he can create
                            a number of levels for classification. Here, mobile phones will fall under smart phones
                            or handsets, further having a branch as touchscreen or keypad, and then another branch for the OS and so on.
                            As such, various taxonomies can be applied to his electronics for easy categorization.
