=====================================

The Product Classification via Taxonomies feature provides the functionality to associate a product to multiple taxonomies.


=================       ===============================================================================================================================================================
**Version:**            1.0

**User Story:**         * As a user, I want to associate a product to a taxonomy and then to another taxonomy to classify the product to multiple taxonomies so that
                          I have a more refined product classification.

**Description:**        * Taxonomies are structured hierarchies which can be used to classify the products in the system.
                        * Products can have multiple taxonomies set by a user to have a more refined classification and easier search.

**Prerequisite:**       * *Articles* created
                        * *Taxonomy*

**Application:**        * This feature is used to easily classify, as well as, to search for a product with the help of taxonomy.
                        * *Example:*

                            If a user has an energy drink as a product that is classified under the *Energy Drinks* taxonomy, the user can also associate the product to the
                            *Beverages* taxonomy that will allow the product to be easily searched by using the taxonomies.
