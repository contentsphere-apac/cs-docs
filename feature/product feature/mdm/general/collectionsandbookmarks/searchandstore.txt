**Version:**            1.0

**User Story:**         * As a user, I want to search for products or assets using various criteria so that I easily identify the items that I want to work on

**Description:**        * The user can save his search and visit it later to see newly added products that satisfy the search criteria.
                        * Bookmarks allow users to save their favorite products as part of a watchlist, enabling them to save their favorite products so that they can easily find such products for comparison or for later view. Matching products are automatically incluced.
                        * Collection includes the products added by the user. A collection always contains the same products unless the user removes them or add other products.

**Prerequisite:**       * Selecting products to be added to your bookmarks

**Application:**        * Users can easily find their favorite products by bookmarking them.
                        * A bookmark is auto-updated with products matching the criteria.
                        * *Example:*

                            A retailer deals with a mixture of washing machines and creates a bookmark named 'fully automated' to group only the fully automated washing machines.
                            If the user wants to see the fully automated washing machines, they search for the keyword 'fully automated' in the bookmark search bar.
                            Whenever a fully automated washing machine is added to the system, it is automatically added to the bookmark.
