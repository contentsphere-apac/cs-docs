=================       =============================================================================================================================================================
**Version:**            1.0

**User Story:**         * As a user, I want to define a bookmark or collection as either Private or Public.

**Description:**        * Private bookmarks are visible only to the user who created those bookmarks, whereas public bookmarks are visible to all users of the system.
                        * A locked icon indicates that the bookmark is a private bookmark.
                        * An unlocked icon indicates that the bookmark is a public bookmark.
                        * To change a bookmark into a private bookmark, user needs to set the bookmark status into a locked icon.

**Prerequisite:**       * User must create a bookmark.

**Application:**        * A bookmark can be a private or a public bookmark.
                        * A private bookmark will only be seen by the user who created the bookmark, and not the other users.
                        * *Example:*

                            Suppose the marketing team of a company has created a bookmark for a trial, so they make the bookmark as a private bookmark because they don't want to show their bookmark to the other users of the system.
                            On the other hand, if they want to share the bookmark with other users, they keep the bookmark as a public bnookmark.
