**Version:**            1.0

**User Story:**         As a user, I want to be able to search products or assets using the multi-criteria search with a multi-faceted search support functionality to refine the results.

**Description:**        * In addition to multi-criteria search, the solution will feature multi-faceted search support functionality to refine results.
                        * A user can refine the results through filters or taxonomy.
                        * A user can sort filters used to sort the products in ascending or descending order.

**Prerequisite:**       * *Taxonomy*  to select taxonomy criteria.
                        * *Application Filter*  to choose the filterable tags.
                        * *Sort by*  to sort the product as per the order.

**Application:**        * Using either of the ways, a user will land to the desired searched product.
                        * A user can use sorting used to sort the products in ascending or descending order.

**How To:**               A **How to do: Multi-faceted Search** document is available to show the steps on how to perform that search.
