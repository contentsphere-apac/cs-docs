CORE 56: Compare Product Revisions
===================================
The Compare Product Revisions feature of PIM allows a user to compare different versions of the same product.


=================       ===============================================================================================================================================================
**Version:**            1.0

**User Story:**         * As a user, I want to to be able to compare different versions of the same product so that I can understand the changes made across the versions.

**Description:**        * This feature allows a user to compare the versions of a product/article.
                        * This feature gives an overview of the similarities and differences of comparable versions to track the changes made over a period of time.
                        * This feature creates a comparison table that contains columns for the products (or services) and rows for the attributes. This enables a user
                          to check the changes made in the versions of the article.

**Prerequisite:**       * Selecting a product with different versions for comparison.

**Application:**        * A user can compare and track the changes done in the version.
                        * *Example:*

                            A Red Bull product is created with no short description. Later on, the user adds a description to the product.  When he saves the product
                            with the new description, a version is created. In the timeline, the user can compare these versions and track the changes.

**How To:**               A **How to do: Compare Product Revisions** document is available that provides the steps on how to compare product revisions.
