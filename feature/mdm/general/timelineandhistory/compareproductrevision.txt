==================================
CORE 78: Compare Product Revision
==================================
The Compare Product Revision feature allows the selection and comparison of different versions of the same product.
It also allows merging of specific values from previous versions into the latest version.


=================       ===============================================================================================================================================================
**Version:**            1.0

**User Story:**         * As a user, I want to select and compare different versions of the same product and merge specific values from the previous revision of the product
                          into the latest revision.

**Description:**        * This feature allows a user to compare versions of a product/article.
                        * This feature gives an overview of the similarities and differences of comparable versions and merge values from any previous version to the newer version.
                        * This feature creates a comparison table that uses columns for the products (or services) and rows for the attributes.  This table allows quick and easy
                          comparison between each offering's features and characteristics.

**Prerequisite:**       * Products created with versions.

**Application:**        * A user can track all the changes that are made to a version and based on values, a user can merge a value from a previous version to the newer one.
                        * *Example:*

                            For a Red bull product, a short description is provided and then some additional changes are done which are not required.
                            In the timeline, a user can compare these two versions and merge the appropriate values for the description.

**How To:**               A **How to do: Compare Product Revision** document is available that provides the steps on how to compare product versions and how to merge values.
