**User Story:**         As a user, I can change the values of multiple attributes/tags for multiple products in a single operation.

**Description:**        * This feature can change the values of multiple attributes/tags for multiple products in a single operation.
                        * This feature can be used on similar or dissimilar types of products.
                        * This feature allows multiple attributes/tags to be edited in a single operation.
                        * This feature allows multiple attributes/tags to be changed and applied to products.

**Prerequisite:**       *Products* to apply the bulk editing.

**Application:**        * Bulk Edit is used to support a variety of actions, such as: *editing, labeling, changing states, moving, or deleting*.
                        * Bulk Edit saves hours of manual work by editing products in batch instead of one product at a time.
                        * Bulk Edit provides the functionality to change and set a variety of product attributes like *price, compare at price, weight, tags, and more*.
                        * *Example:*

                            A food company changed their tagline or description for their products. The company can select their products in the system and change the
                            description using bulk edit. It can also apply the description change to all of their products.

**How To:**              A **How to do: Bulk Edit** document is available to provide information on how to do the mass editing.
