=================       =============================================================================================================================================================
**Version:**            1.0

**User Story:**         * As an administrator, I want to add taxonomies so that I can classify products into them.

**Description:**        * Taxonomy allows for classifying different objects.
                        * This feature deals on how to map an object to different concepts and terms to a consistent structure.
                        * Taxonomies can also represent related concepts that can be used to connect a product to various levels of taxonomy branches.

**Prerequisite:**       * Selecting a parent node to get all nodes associated to that particular parent node

**Application:**        * Multi-classifying an object
                        * Driving information through the applied taxonomy
                        * Giving the object a hierarchy to show all related concepts
                        * *Example:*

                            An electronics retailer sells all kinds of electronics and he wants to classify his products.
                            The mobile phones that he sells will have a taxonomy "electronics" and under electronics, he can create
                            a number of levels for classification. Here, mobile phones will fall under smart phones
                            or handsets, further having a branch as touchscreen or keypad, and then another branch for the OS and so on.
                            Similarly, various taxonomies can be applied to his electronics for smooth categorization.
