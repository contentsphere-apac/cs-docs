=================       =============================================================================================================================================================
**Version:**            1.0

**User Story:**         * As an administrator, I want to add taxonomies so that I can classify products into them.

**Description:**        * Taxonomy enables us to classify different objects
                        * This feature deals on how to map an object to different concepts and terms to a consistent structure.
                        * Taxonomies can also represent related concepts that can be used to connect a product to various levels of branches of a taxonomy.

**Prerequisite:**       * Selecting a parent node to get all nodes associated to that particular parent node

**Application:**        * To multi-classify an object.
                        * To drive information through the applied taxonomy
                        * Giving the object a hierarchy to show all related concepts
                        * *Example:*

                            For an electronics retailer who sells all kinds of electronics, he wants to classify his products.
                            So the mobile phones that he sells will have a taxonomy "electronics" and under electronics, he can create
                            a number of levels to classify his mobile phones under electronics. So here the mobile phone will fall under smart phones
                            or handsets further having a  branch as touch screen or keypad and then another branch for the OS and so on.
                            Similarly, various taxonomies can be applied to his electronicsa for smooth categorization.
