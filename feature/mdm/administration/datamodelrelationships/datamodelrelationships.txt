======================================
The Data Model Relationships feature provides information on the various relationships that can be set up in the system.


=================       ===============================================================================================================================================================
**Version:**            1.0

**User Story:**         * As an administrator, I want to set up relationships between a *Product* and an *Asset* as bi-directional relationship.
                        * As an administrator, I want to set up relationships between *Articles* as bi-directional relationship.
                        * As an administrator, I want to set up relationships between *Entities*.

**Description:**        * This feature provides the functionality that allows the linking of a product to its details. This will also allow the linking of additional information about
                          the images associated with the products, markets, etc.
                        * This feature provides the functionality that creates relationships that will relate *Products* to the *Markets, Suppliers, Images, Videos, etc*.
                        * This feature provides the functionality that creates relationships that can be bi-directional in which the product can be related to the
                          image/market/supplier and the product will be visible in the image/market/supplier modules.
                        * *Example:*

                            A product is linked to a particular supplier. In the supplier module, the supplier can view all the products that he had supplied.

**Prerequisite:**       * *Products*, *Assets*, *Articles*, *Entities* to apply the relationships.

**Application:**        * Define Article Links will be able to link rich content to the products like adding multiple images, videos, PDFs, or even the market
                          that the products are available in.
                        * Define Article Links will be able to create relationships that show the way two or more entities are connected or the state of being connected.
                        * Define Article Links will be able to create bi-directional relationships. This means that the linking of products to different modules can be seen
                          if you enter into the module entities.
                        * Define Article Links will be able to create relationships that can be used to *cross-sell* products. An administrator can define a
                          relationship between two products that will prompt the system to suggest the linked products if a customer buys the other product.
                        * *Example:*

                            In a product-to-product relationship, a link is created between a movie product and a soundtrack product. Once done,
                            if a user buys a movie, the system will be able to offer the soundtrack of that movie to the user, as well.
