DAGOV 2: Must/Should Attributes
================================
The Must/Should Attributes are part of the data governance feature that will determine the mandatory characteristic of a data field.


=================       ===============================================================================================================================================================
**Version:**            1.0

**User Story:**         * As a user, I want to be alerted if any *Must/Should* attributes (data fields) are not filled out so that I can effectively complete the product definition.
                        * As an administrator, I would like to set *Must/Should/Can* conditions in the data fields.

**Description:**        * This feature provides the functionality to set and classify fields into three categories: *Must, Should, and Can*.
                            * **Must:** is a mandatory field.
                            * **Should:** is a mandatory field but can be skipped. Skipping this field will cause a *"warning"*.
                            * **Can:** is an optional field that can be skipped.
                        * This feature defines that *Must* fields are mandatory fields. Must fields are also called *compulsory* fields.
                        * This feature defines that *Should* and *Can* fields are optional fields. An optional field is the opposite of a mandatory field.
                          Optional fields are also called *voluntary* fields. The system saves the changes on a page even if these fields are not populated.
                        * This feature allows the system to show a warning message if a *Must* field is left empty. The system saves any changes done on the page as well.
                        * This feature allows the setting of *Is Mandatory (Must, Should, Can)*, which is a flag that can be raised at a class level for each attribute and tag.

**Prerequisite:**       * *Must / Should / Can* type to be selected for the attributes under the mandatory field section in the class configuration.

**Application:**        * The system will be able to communicate to a user the type of fields present on the page to prevent errors and minimize workload.
                        * The system will be able to show that a field is mandatory that will prevent validation errors upon submission.
                        * The system will be able to show that a field is optional that will allow a user to get through the process faster.
                        * *Example:*

                             An administrator has to create a new user.  While filling out the form fields like *Username, Password, Emails*, a notification message will show
                             if those fields are left blank since these are mandatory fields and are required to be completed. Whereas, fields like *Gender, First Name, etc.*
                             can be set as optional fields, thus, be left blank.
