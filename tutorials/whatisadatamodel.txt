=====================
What is a Data Model?
=====================

The Data Model defines the base data structure for products in a system.
This structure enables you to connect predefined classes or taxonomies with your products to classify them.
The Data Model defines products from the highest level of classification down to the individual attributes and properties.


**Example:**

    A product, such as a *T-Shirt*, inherently has a Data Model that defines it. At the highest level, it is given a *Nature Class*, which could be *Product*.
    This Product class allows the *T-Shirt* to have variants.  At this level, the *T-Shirt* describes the design but is not a sellable item.

    The Data Model for your *T-Shirt* also has Non-Nature/Attribution classes such as *'Clothing'*.
    The *Clothing* Attribution Class attaches properties such as fabric and color to the *T-Shirt* product.
    The Taxonomy is used to add the *T-Shirt* product into a broader store classification or a category system.
