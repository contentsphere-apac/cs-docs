Realtime Mapping
=================
Real-Time Mapping allows the user/partner to map attributes and tags of the products to the processes before or during the onboarding process.

Prerequisites
=============
* Onboarding sheet
* Predefined roles
* Predefined organizations


Key Terms
=========
* **Mappings** - The Mapping section allows to map different elements (attributes, tag, classes, and taxonomies) defined in an onboarding file to the similar elements (the attributes, tag, classes, and taxonomies) defined in the system.

* **Endpoint** - The endpoint is the final process where we map the partners with the defined process. This endpoint will be visible on the partnerâ€™s dashboard.
