Define Article-Asset Relationship in an Onboarding File
=======================================================

#.	We define relationship between articles and assets in Article-Asset Relationship sheet. We define which assets are used for an article in this sheet.
#.  We defined all articles in an Article sheet and assets in Asset sheet. In Article-Asset Relationship sheet, we will take the article and asset reference from Article
    and Asset sheets respectively.
#.	This sheet will contain the following details column wise:
#.	**Source**: You need to mention the unique identification of an article in this column. This will be the ArticleID defined in the Article sheet.

#	**Destination**: You need to mention the unique identification of an asset that you want to associate with article.
This will be the AssetID defined in the Asset sheet. *Note: There can be multiple assets associated with a single article, so there can be multiple entries/ rows of different Destination for a single Source.*
