Configure Workflow
===================
To configure a workflow, follow the detailed steps listed below:


|

#.	Log in to the application and click on the **Administration** button.

|
|


#.	Go to the *Data Integration* tab and then to *Workflow*.

|
|


#.	Click the "+" icon to create a new workflow.

|
|


#.	Provide the following details: *Name, Event Type, and Code*. Then, click on the **Create** button.

|
|


#.	Select the created workflow and a pop-up window will open where you can define the workflow of onboarding process.

.. image:: /tutorials/_images/cs_configureworkflow_selectthecreatedwf.PNG
|
|


#.	The *Graph section* in the pop-up window is divided into three vertical sections. The first 2 vertical sections are called **Workflow Modeler**. It allows users to configure workflows using the *BPMN 2.0 Modeling Notation*. This can model complex onboarding processes using universally known and standardized BPMN 2.0 notation. The third vertical section contains the details of each component of onboarding file.

|
|


#.	Drag and drop the notations in the *Workflow Modeler* to define the onboarding process. The workflow starts with a **Start Event**. It acts as a process trigger so the first element in the workflow will be the **Start Event**.

|
|


#.	Select the **Start Event** notation to see all the options that you can add after this component. It will appear on the right side of the component.

|
|


#.	Add the notations to define a workflow according to the onboarding file. For example, if you want to add an *Article* in a flow, click on the **Task Notation**. Custom actions for different users will be managed through the workflow task.

|


#.	Click on a **Task Notation** to add it to the process.

|
|


#.  Note that adding a task notation simply defines the task. Next step is to define what kind of a task it is: whether it is *Import Article, Import Asset, or Import Relationship, etc*. Do this by clicking on the **Change Type** icon (icon that looks like a wrench).

.. image:: /tutorials/_images/cs_configureworkflow_notethatadding.PNG

|


#.	Once clicked, a pop-up window will appear that contains the various tasks.

.. image:: /tutorials/_images/cs_configureworkflow_onceclickedvarioustasks.PNG
|
|


#.  To define an *Article*, select the *Article Import* option from the list.

|
|


#.	Double click on the created task and provide a name.

.. image:: /tutorials/_images/cs_configureworkflow_doubleclickonthecreatedtask.PNG
|
|


#.	Define all the components of the system like *Assets, Relationships, Nature Classes, etc* in a similar manner - Creating a task then, selecting its type by clicking on the wrench icon and lastly, naming it.

.. image:: /tutorials/_images/cs_configureworkflow_defineallthecomponents.PNG
|
|


#.	Once all the needed components are added, append the **End Event** notation. It represents the end of the process/flow. Select the last component and click on the **End Event** notation.

.. image:: /tutorials/_images/cs_configureworkflow_onceallneededcomponentsareadded.PNG
|
|


#.	Check that the **End Event** notation is appended.

|
|


#.	Click on each component and fill out the details of each component (third vertical section): *Sheet Name, Primary Key Column, Type, Class ID/Class Column, Multiclassification, Type, Select Classes/Class Column Name, and Taxonomies*. Click on the **Save** button.

25        Sheet Name                             The onboarding file is an Excel file. Excel file may contain different sheets in it. Here, we need to mention the sheet name which contains the component details.

26        Primary Key Column                     All the defined products in an onboarding file have unique identification or IDs. Here, in Primary Key Column we need to define the column name of the sheet which contains the unique IDs of the products. So, system will fetch all the IDs of the product from the defined column of the sheet.

27        Type                                   Here we need to select one of the options from below mentioned options:

                                                    * **Single Class:** Select this option, if all defined products in an onboarding file use the same class in the system. For example, if all the products are *Individual Article* or all the products are *PID*.

                                                    * **Column Class:** Select this option, if all defined products in an onboarding file use different types of classes in the system. For example, there are two products in a sheet; one is *Individual Article* and the other one is *PID*.

28        Class ID/Class Column                  The value of this field is based on the selection in the *Type* field:

                                                    * **Class ID:** When all the defined products in an onboarding file use the same class in the system, we select **Single Class** option in the *Type* field. In this case, we need to select that system generated class from the list as **Class ID**.

                                                    * **Class Column:** When defined products in an onboarding file use different classes in the system, we select **Column Class** option in the *Type* field. In this case, we need to enter the column name of the sheet, which contains the IDs of all the classes in a Class Column field.

29        Multiclassification                    Select this option, if defined products in a sheet use *Non-Nature Classes*.

30        Type                                   As soon as you select the **MultiClassification** option, this option will be visible. Here, we need to select one of the options from below:

                                                    * **Multiple Class:** Select this option, if defined products in an onboarding file use multiple system generated non-nature classes.

                                                    * **Column Class:** Select this option, if defined products in an onboarding file use multiple non-nature classes, which are yet to be created.

31        Select Classes/Class Column name       The value of this field is based on the selection in the *Type* field.

                                                    * **Select Classes:** When all the defined products in an onboarding file use multiple system generated non-nature classes, we select **Multiple Class** option in the *Type* field. In this case, we need to select the system generated classes from the list.

In this case, we need to enter the column name of the sheet, which contains the IDs of all the non-nature classes in a **Class Column Name** field.

32        Taxonomies                            Here, we need to enter the column name of the sheet of an onboarding file which contains the taxonomy details.
