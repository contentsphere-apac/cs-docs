|
|


#.	Click the "+" icon to create a new workflow.

.. image:: /tutorials/_images/cs_configureworkflow_clicktheicon.PNG
|
|


#.	Provide the following details: *Name, Event Type, and Code*. Then, click on the **Create** button.

.. image:: /tutorials/_images/cs_configureworkflow_providetheffdetails.PNG
|
|


#.	Select the created workflow and a pop-up window will open where you can define the workflow of the onboarding process.

.. image:: /tutorials/_images/cs_configureworkflow_selectthecreatedwf.PNG
|
|


#.	The *Graph section* in the pop-up window is divided into three vertical sections. The first and second vertical sections are called **Workflow Modeler**. It allows users to configure workflows using the *BPMN 2.0 Modeling Notation*. This can model complex onboarding processes using universally known and standardized notation. The third vertical section contains the details of each component of onboarding file.

.. image:: /tutorials/_images/cs_configureworkflow_thegraphsection.PNG
|
|


#.	Drag and drop the notations in the *Workflow Modeler* to define the onboarding process. The workflow starts with a **Start Event**. It acts as a process trigger so the first element in the workflow will be the **Start Event**.

.. image:: /tutorials/_images/cs_configureworkflow_draganddrop.PNG
|
|


#.	Select the **Start Event** notation to see all the options that you can add after this component. It will appear on the right side of the component.

.. image:: /tutorials/_images/cs_configureworkflow_selectthestartevent.PNG
|
|


#.	Add the notations to define a workflow according to the onboarding file. For example, if you want to add an *Article* in a flow, click on the **Task Notation**. Custom actions for different users will be managed through the workflow task.

.. image:: /tutorials/_images/cs_configureworkflow_addthenotations.PNG
|
|


#.	Click on a **Task Notation** to add it to the process.

.. image:: /tutorials/_images/cs_configureworkflow_clickonatasknotation.PNG
|
|


#.  Note that adding a task notation simply defines the task. Next step is to define what kind of a task it is: whether it is *Import Article, Import Asset, or Import Relationship, etc*. Do this by clicking on the **Change Type** icon (icon that looks like a wrench).

.. image:: /tutorials/_images/cs_configureworkflow_notethatadding.PNG
|
|


#.	Once clicked, a pop-up window will appear that contains the various tasks.

.. image:: /tutorials/_images/cs_configureworkflow_onceclickedvarioustasks.PNG
|
|


#.  To define an *Article*, select the *Article Import* option from the list.

.. image:: /tutorials/_images/cs_configureworkflow_todefineanarticle.PNG
|
|


#.	Double click on the created task and provide a name.

.. image:: /tutorials/_images/cs_configureworkflow_doubleclickonthecreatedtask.PNG
|
|


#.	Define all the components of the system like *Assets, Relationships, Nature Classes, etc* in a similar manner - (1) creating a task, (2) selecting its type by clicking on the wrench icon and (3) naming it.

.. image:: /tutorials/_images/cs_configureworkflow_defineallthecomponents.PNG
|
|


#.	Once all the needed components are added, append the **End Event** notation. It represents the end of the process/flow. Select the last component and click on the **End Event** notation.

.. image:: /tutorials/_images/cs_configureworkflow_onceallneededcomponentsareadded.PNG
|
|


#.	Check that the **End Event** notation is appended.

.. image:: /tutorials/_images/cs_configureworkflow_checkthattheendevent.PNG
|
|


#.	Click on each component and fill out the details of each component (third vertical section): *Sheet Name, Primary Key Column, Type, Class ID/Class Column, Multiclassification, Type, Select Classes/Class Column Name, and Taxonomies*. Click on the **Save** button.

5         Start Event                           It acts as a process trigger. The first element in the flow will be the **Start Event**.

6         Intermediate Event                    It represents something that happens between **Start Event and End Event**.

7         End Event                             It represents the end of flow. It will be the last element while defining a workflow of onboarding process.

8         Exclusive Gateway                     It is used to select only one of the paths from the created alternative paths or flows, depending on a condition.

9         Parallel Gateway                      It is used to create parallel paths without evaluating any conditions.

10        Inclusive Gateway                     It is used to create alternative flows where all paths are evaluated.

11        Complex Gateway                       It is used only for the most complex flows in the business process.
                                                Use the **Complex Gateway** if you need multiple gateways to describe the business flow.

12        Event Based Gateway                   The condition determining the path of a process is based on an evaluated event.

13        Task                                  A task is a type of activity which cannot be broken down further to a basic level of business process details.

14        Send Task                             It is a type of task, which is used to send a message.

15        Receive Task                          It is a type of task, which is used to send a message. It is a simple task that waits for the arrival of a certain message.

16        User Task                             A User Task is used to model work that needs to be done by a human actor.

17        Manual Task                           It is used to model work that is done by somebody who the engine does not need to know of.

18        Business Rule Task                    It is used to synchronously execute one or more rules.

19        Service Task                          It is used to invoke services.

20        Script Task                           It is an automated activity.

21        Subprocess                            It is a compound activity. It can be expanded or collapsed to show or hide the flow objects.

22        Transaction                           **Transaction** is a form of subprocess in which all activities must be treated as an individual activity.
                                                All the activities of a transaction must be completed to meet the objective.
                                                If any one of them fails, then all activities must be reverted.

23        Data Object                           It is used store the information used by your business processes.

24        Data Store                            It provides a mechanism to retrieve or update stored information of process.

25        Sheet Name                             The onboarding file is an *Excel file*. Excel file may contain different sheets in it. Here, we need to mention the sheet name which contains the component details.

26        Primary Key Column                     All the defined products in an onboarding file have unique identification or IDs.
                                                 Here, in Primary Key Column, we need to define the column name of the sheet which contains the unique IDs of the product
                                                 so the system will fetch all of the IDs of the product from the defined column of the sheet.

27        Type                                   Here, we need to select one of the options from below:

                                                    * **Single Class:** Select this option, if all defined products in an onboarding file use the same class in the system.
                                                      For example, if all the products are *Individual Article* or all the products are *PID*.

                                                    * **Column Class:** Select this option, if all defined products in an onboarding file use different types of classes in the system.
                                                      For example, there are two products in a sheet; one is *Individual Article* and the other one is *PID*.

28        Class ID/Class Column                  The value of this field is based on the selection in the *Type* field:

                                                    * **Class ID:** When all the defined products in an onboarding file use the same class in the system,
                                                      we select **Single Class** option in the *Type* field. In this case, we need to select that system generated class from the list as **Class ID**.

                                                    * **Class Column:** When defined products in an onboarding file use different classes in the system,
                                                      we select **Column Class** option in the *Type* field.
                                                      In this case, we need to enter the column name of the sheet, which contains the IDs of all the classes in a *Class Column* field.

29        Multiclassification                    Select this option, if defined products in a sheet use *Non-Nature Classes*.

30        Type                                   As soon as you select the **MultiClassification** option, this option will be visible. Here, we need to select one of the options from below:

                                                    * **Multiple Class:** Select this option, if defined products in an onboarding file use multiple system generated non-nature classes.

                                                    * **Column Class:** Select this option, if defined products in an onboarding file use multiple non-nature classes, which are yet to be created.

31        Select Classes/Class Column name       The value of this field is based on the selection in the *Type* field.

                                                    * **Select Classes:** When all the defined products in an onboarding file use multiple system generated non-nature classes,
                                                      we select **Multiple Class** option in the *Type* field. In this case, we need to select the system generated classes from the list.

                                                    * **Class Column Name:** When defined products in an onboarding file use multiple non-nature classes which are yet to be created,
                                                      we select **Column Class** option in the *Type* field. In this case, we need to enter the column name of the sheet,
                                                      which contains the IDs of all the non-nature classes in a **Class Column Name** field.

32        Taxonomies                            Here, we need to enter the column name of the sheet of an onboarding file which contains the taxonomy details.

33        Save                                  Click on the **Save** button to save the workflow details.
