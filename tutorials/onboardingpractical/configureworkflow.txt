|
|


#.	The *Graph section* in the pop-up window is divided into three vertical sections. The first 2 vertical sections are called **Workflow Modeler**. It allows users to configure workflows using the *BPMN 2.0 Modeling Notation*. This can model complex onboarding processes using universally known and standardized BPMN 2.0 notation. The third vertical section contains the details of each component of onboarding file.

#.	Drag and drop the notations in the *Workflow Modeler* to define the onboarding process. The workflow starts with a **Start Event**. It acts as a process trigger so the first element in the workflow will be the **Start Event**.

#.	Add the notations to define a workflow according to the onboarding file. For example, if you want to add an *Article* in a flow, click on the **Task Notation**. Custom actions for different users will be managed through the workflow task.
