* Onboarding
    Onboarding is the process of transferring product data from a partner’s system to the main PIM.
    The product details are put together in a file and then uploaded into the retailer’s PIM system. The PIM will fetch the details of the file and validate it with the MDM.

* Offboarding
    The offboarding process allows the user to export product data from Contentserv.
    The data can be downloaded as a file that can be pushed out to channels such as ecommerce.

* User
    The user is someone who logs into the Contentserv system.

* Role
    A role defines the permissions of a user in the system. An organization can have several roles such as an *Administrator* or a *General User*.
    The roles vary between organizations but can be created to match the roles in your company.

    Nature Classes could include *Single Article, Product, Bundle, or other custom-made product types*.

    *Attribution Class*: (also called Non-Nature Class) A class that adds specific attributes to the product it is assigned to.
    For example, a Mobile Phone class may add attributes for *Screen Size, Memory Size, Operating System*, etc.
