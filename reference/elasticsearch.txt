ElasticSearch: Search Store
============================

Brief
-----

The *ElasticSearch* search engine, in spite of being a secondary store is one of the main core components.
It is used to perform all search operations and several get operations. *ElasticSearch* supports full-text, faceted, and semantic & phonetic searching.
Additionally, it is also horizontally scalable, thereby, giving us a flexibility to increase the number of nodes in order to facilitate high volume searches.

For *ElasticSearch* search store, fast SSD drives are recommended as they can bear lots of random *IOPS*, therefore avoiding performance bottlenecks.
*ElasticSearch* is extremely memory intensive. In the latter, sorting and aggregations can both be memory hungry so enough heap space to accommodate this is important.
Even when the heap is comparatively small, extra memory can be given to the OS file system cache. As many data structures used by Lucene (full-featured text search engine, which forms the crux of ElasticSearch) are disk-based formats, ElasticSearch leverages the OS cache to great effect.
