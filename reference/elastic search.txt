ElasticSearch : Search Store
Brief :-
The ElasticSearch search engine, in spite of being a secondary store is one of the main core components as it is used to perform all search operations and several get operations. ElasticSearch supports full text, faceted search, and semantic and phonetic search. Additionally, it is also horizontally scalable thereby giving us a flexibility to increase the number of nodes in order to facilitate high volume searches.
For ElasticSearch Search Store, fast SSD drives are recommended as they can bear lots of random IOPS, therefore avoiding performance bottlenecks.
ElasticSearch is extremely memory intensive. In the latter, sorting and aggregations can both be memory hungry, so enough heap space to accommodate it is important. Even when the heap is comparatively small, extra memory can be given to the OS file system cache. As many data structures used by Lucene (full-featured text search engine, which forms the crux of ElasticSearch) are disk-based formats, ElasticSearch leverages the OS cache to great effect.
Installation :-
