Implementation Guide
=====================
This page will help you, a Contentserv user to understand the basic concepts surrounding a product.
After reading through the content of this page, you should be able to define what a product is as it pertains to Contentserv and the various types that you can set up in the system.

|

What is a Product?
===================
Products are merchandise offered to a market by a supplier to satisfy a need or demand.  A product is manufactured through a process and provides benefit to its intended market.
A chair, a table, and a ‘set of furniture’ for the dining room are examples of products. Similarly, a product can also be an idea or a service.

In the Contentserv Global System, a product can be a placeholder for a group of items of the same model or a stand-alone item up for sale. Here, you can create a product, enrich it with relevant images, videos and classify it according to its specific details.

What are the various types of Products in Contentserv?
=======================================================
To give our customers the liberty of displaying the products in the most attractive manner that will also aid with their promotional activities,
we have introduced various types of products, a detailed account of same is described in the following section.

Each type of product has a unique set of values/attributes that can be assigned to it. Having various types of products enhances its use and makes it more relevant for the market.
Say, a *Chair* is a good stand-alone product to sell, but a *Dining Table* usually sells and comes with chairs.

|

Here is a list of the types of products that can be set up in the system:

* Single Article
* Bundle
* Fixed Bundle
* Set of products
* Promotional Collections
* PID
* Unit
* Standard Identifier

|

Single Article
---------------
A *Single Article* is a stand-alone sellable item. This product type is usually used to create independent products.

*Example:*

  Dog Bed.

Also, a single article can be a chair, a table lamp, a mattress and so on.

These *Single Articles* can be sold individually or grouped together to make a bundle.

* *Example:*

    Furnishing items like chair, table, sofa, table lamp are individual items for sale; when put together in a bundle, they form a ‘living room set’.

And that introduces you to the next product type- **Bundle**.

|

Bundle
-------
A bundle is a collection of items put together by the retailer for sale.
In Contentserv, a user (authorized person to use the system) can create two types of bundles: **(1) Fixed Bundle** and **(2) Threshold (or Loose) Bundle**.
