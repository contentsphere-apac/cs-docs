                        * A lock icon indicates that the bookmark is a private. bookmark
                        * An unlock icon indicates that the bookmark is a public bookmark.

                        * *Example:*


                        Suppose the marketing team of a company has created a bookmark for a trial,
                        they make the bookmark as a private bookmark because they don't want to show their bookmark to the other users of the system.
                        On the other hand, if they want to share the bookmark with other users, they keep the bookmark as a public bnookmark.
