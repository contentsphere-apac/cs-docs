=================       =============================================================================================================================================================
**Version:**            1.0

**User Story:**         As a user, I want to search products or assets using various/detailed criteria so that I easily identify the items that I want to work on

**Description:**        * The user can save his search and visit it later to see newly added products that satisfy the search criteria.
                        * Bookmark allows users to save their favorite products as part of a watchlist so that they can easily find such products for comparison or for later view.
                        * Collection includes the products added by the user. A collection always contains the same products unless the user removes them or add other products.

**Prerequisite:**       User must select the products to be added in the bookmarks.

**Application:**        * A user can easily find his favorite products through bookmarking them.
                        * A bookmark is autoupdated with products matching the criteria.
                        * *Examples:*

                          A relatiler deals with a mixture of washing machine and creates a bookmark named 'fully automated' to group only the fully automated washing machines.
                          If the user wants to see the fully automated washing machines, he searches for the keyword 'fully automated' in the bookmark search bar.
                          When a fully automated washing machine is added to the system, it is automatically added to the bookmark.
