Tasks to Complete Actions
==========================
The Tasks to Complete Actions feature automates the assigning of tasks to users involved in a process or workflow.


====================      ===============================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term:**              * **Workflow Tasks:** are tasks assigned to users depending on the business logic arranged through the Workflow Modeler.
                             These tasks will allow the Modeler to have complex custom actions through Tasks.
                             Custom actions for different users that are required in the process will be managed through the Workflow Tasks.

**Description:**           * Workflow Tasks automate the process of assigning the tasks to the users that will allow easy management of these tasks.

**Application:**           * *Example:*

                                An *Electronic Retailer* wants to create a to-do list for all the tasks in order to manage these tasks.
                                He can go to the *Workflow Workbench* from the dashboard to see all of his tasks.

* Adding a *Task Notation* simply defines the task.  Provide more definition to what kind of task it is by identifying whether it is an *import article, import asset, import relationship*, etc.
   Do this by clicking on the **Change Type** icon (icon that looks like a wrench).
