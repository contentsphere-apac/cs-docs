Modeler to Design Workflow
===========================
The Modeler to Design Workflow feature allows the user to configure a workflow using the modeler.


====================    ================================================================================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term:**           * **Workflow:** a workflow is a graphical representation of the internal onboarding process. It shows the sequence of workflow and the messages that flow in between the related set of activities.
                          It provides the capability of understanding the internal onboarding procedures in a graphical notation and will give an organization the ability to communicate this procedure in a standard manner.
                        * **Workflow Modeler:** a workflow modeler allows users to configure workflows using BPMN 2.0 modelling notation.
                          This will enable users to model complex processes using universally known and standardized BPMN 2.0 notation.

**Description:**        * A workflow represents the end-to-end flow of a business process in a graphical manner.
                        * The workflow modeler provides a standard notation readily understandable by all business stakeholders.

**Application:**        * Use the workflow modeler to create a graphical representation of a business process.
                        * *Example:*

            							   A fashion retailer wants to create a workflow for the onboarding process. He can do this by using the workflow modeler.

How-to: Configure Workflow Using Workflow Modeler
=====================================================
To configure a workflow, follow these steps:

|


#. Log in to the application. Click on the **Administration** icon.

|
|


#. Navigate to **Data Integration** --> **Workflow** menu.

|
|


#. Click on the "+" icon to create the workflow.

|
|


#. Enter the details such as *Name*, *Event Type*, and *Code*, then click on the **Create** button.

|
|


#. Select the created workflow to open a pop-up window where you can define the workflow of the onboarding process.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_modelertodesignworkflow_selectcreatedworkflow.PNG
|
|


#. The *Graph* section in the pop-up window is divided into three vertical sections. The first two vertical sections are called *Workflow Modeler*. It allows to configure workflows using BPMN 2.0 modelling notation.
   This will allow users to model complex onboarding process using universally known and standardized BPMN 2.0 notation.

|
|


#. Drag and drop the notations in *Workflow Modeler* to define the onboarding process. A workflow starts with the **Start Event**. The **Start Event** acts as a process trigger so it is the first element in a workflow.

|
|


#. Select the **Start Event** notation to show the options for that notation.

|
|


#. Start adding the notations to define a workflow according to the onboarding file. For example, if you want to add *Article* in the workflow, then click on the **Task** notation.
   Custom actions for different users will be managed through the workflow **Task**.

|
|


#. Once you click on the **Task** notation, it gets added in the workflow.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_modelertodesignworkflow_clicktasknotation.PNG
|
|


#. Adding the **Task** notation simply defines the task. Click on the **Wrench** icon to define what kind of a task it is, whether it is *import article*, *import asset*, *import relationship*, etc.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_modelertodesignworkflow_addtask.PNG
|
|


#. As soon as you click on the **Wrench** icon, a window appears containing the types of task.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_modelertodesignworkflow_clickwrenchicon.PNG
|
|


#. If you are defining an article, select the **Article Import** option from the list.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_modelertodesignworkflow_selectarticleimport.PNG
|
|


#. Double-click on the created task icon and enter a name for that icon.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_modelertodesignworkflow_doubleclick.PNG
|
|


#. Define the components of the system such as *Assets, Relationships, and Nature Classes*. Create a task, click on the **Wrench** icon to select the type, and enter a name for that task.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_modelertodesignworkflow_definecomponents.PNG
|
|


#. Once you added all the components in a workflow, append the **End Event** notation at the end. It represents the end of the workflow. Select the last component and click on the **End Event** notation.

|


#. View the **End Event** notation appended at the end of the workflow.

.. image:: /feature/_images/mdmimages/cs_modelertodesignworkflow_viewendevent.PNG
|

#. Click on a component and in the third vertical section, fill in the details of the component such as *Sheet Name, Primary Key Column, Type, Class ID/Class Column, Multiclassification, Type, Select Classes/Class Column Name* and *Taxonomies*.
   Perform this step for each component then click on the **Save** button.
