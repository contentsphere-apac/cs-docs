**Key Term:**            * **Tags**: Properties that describe the products.

**Description:**        * Criteria of relevancy must be established when presenting products since different personas can have different preferences or affinities.
                        * Even products carry affinities like some products are suitable during winter while some are intended for summer.
                        * Affinity-based tags allow you to show the products that correspond to a persona.
