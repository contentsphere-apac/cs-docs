Manage Taxonomy
================
The feature, *'Manage Taxonomy’* is an interface that provides users the ability to create, update, edit, or delete taxonomies.
It is the primary way that we update taxonomies in the Contentsphere system.


====================    =============================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term:**           * **Taxonomy:** a taxonomy is a scheme of classification used for an organization's products.

**Description:**        * Taxonomy management is facilitated in the configuration section of Contentsphere.
                        * The interface gives you the flexibility to add levels to the taxonomy vertically and horizontally.
                        * When the taxonomy is given a level vertically, it becomes more specific under that category.
                          For example, a taxonomy may have a *Fashion* category which may be made more specific with a *Pants* subcategory.
                        * When the taxonomy is given a level horizontally, it adds a new branch that products can be categorized into making the classification broader in scope.
                          For example, a taxonomy with an existing *Fashion* category may also have a *Electronics* category on the same level as *Fashion*.
                          This would reflect a retailer with many different product lines.
                        * Use the **plus (+)** buttons to add levels to your taxonomy, where required.
                        * A store’s taxonomy can be configured in many different ways.

                        * :doc:`Product Classification via Taxonomies </feature/product_feature/mdm/general/multitaxonomyassignment/productclassificationviataxonomies>`

**Application:**        * Let’s create a simple taxonomy for a retailer, which sells fashion and electronics.
                        * The highest level of classification would be *Fashion and Electronics*.
                        * The classification would be made deeper under each category to add specificity.
