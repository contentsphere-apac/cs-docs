**Description:**        * A property collection is a group of attributes, properties, tags, and roles. This collection can be added to a class or taxonomy level.
                        * A user can then categorize a product under that class or taxonomy level to inherit a set of properties.
                        * This feature is useful for product categories with common sets of attributes such as computers.
                          A computer product will have attributes such as CPU, RAM, Battery Life which are common to all computers.
                          Instead of configuring each individual computer product in your catalog with these attributes, the user can categorize the product under a class that inherits the relevant property collection.

**Application:**        * The user has many shoes in their catalog. Each shoe has a common set of properties. The user wants all shoes in their catalog to use the same set of properties.
                        * *Example:*

                            *Attributes: Size US, Size UK, Size EU, Materials, Color*.
                            These attributes are put into a property collection called *Shoes* and assigned to the *Shoes Taxonomy Level*.
                            Once a shoe product is assigned to that level of taxonomy, it will inherit all of the shoe properties defined in the property collection.
