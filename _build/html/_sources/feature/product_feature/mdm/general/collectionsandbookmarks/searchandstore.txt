Search and Store Bookmarks
===========================
Search and Store Bookmarks lets you search for products using various criteria to easily identify items of interest.


====================    =============================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term:**           * **Bookmark:** a self-updating bookmark that saves the results of a search.

**Description:**        * Searches can be saved and viewed later to see the newly added products that satisfy the search criteria.
                        * Bookmarks allow saving of favorite products as part of a watchlist, enabling users to view and compare products.
                        * Collections include the products added by the user. The products in a collection stay the same unless a user adds or removes products.

**Related topics:**     * :doc:`Public or Private Bookmarks and Collections </feature/product_feature/mdm/general/collectionsandbookmarks/bookmarkcollections>`

**Application:**        * Easily find favorite products by bookmarking them.
                        * Never miss out on applicable products as bookmarks are auto-updated.
                        * *Example:*

                            A retailer deals with a mixture of washing machines and creates a bookmark named 'fully automated' to group only the fully automated washing machines.
                            If the user wants to see the fully automated washing machines, he searches for the keyword 'fully automated' in the bookmark search bar.
                            Whenever a fully automated washing machine is added to the system, it is automatically added to the bookmark.
