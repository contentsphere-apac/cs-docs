Product Classification via Taxonomies
=====================================
The Product Classification via Taxonomies feature provides the functionality to associate a product to multiple taxonomies.


===================     ===============================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term:**           * **Taxonomy:** a taxonomy is a scheme of classification used for an organizationâ€™s products.

**Description:**        * The feature associates a product to a taxonomy and then to another taxonomy that will classify the product to multiple taxonomies so that
                          there is a refined product classification.
                        * Taxonomies are structured hierarchies which can be used to classify the products in the system.
                        * Products can have multiple taxonomies set by a user to have a more refined classification and easier search.

**Related topics:**     * :doc:`Multi-Taxonomy Assignment </feature/product_feature/mdm/general/multitaxonomyassignment/multitaxonomyassignment>`

**Application:**        * This feature is used to easily classify, as well as, to search for a product with the help of taxonomy.
                        * *Example:*

                            If a user has an energy drink as a product that is classified under the *Energy Drinks* taxonomy, the user can also associate the product to the
                            *Beverages* taxonomy that will allow the product to be easily searched by using the taxonomies.
