Multi-taxonomy Assignment
=========================
The Multi-taxonomy Assignment feature provides general users the capability to assign an object to various taxonomies or to multiple nodes within the same taxonomy.


===================     ==========================================================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term:**           * **Taxonomy:** a taxonomy is a scheme of classification used for an organizationâ€™s products.

**Description:**        * The feature assigns a single object to multiple different taxonomies or to multiple nodes within the same taxonomy.
                        * The feature allows multiple taxonomies to be assigned to a single product.
                        * The feature enhances the classification of products/articles in a more structured way.

**Related topics:**     * :doc:`Product Classification via Taxonomies </feature/product_feature/mdm/general/multitaxonomyassignment/productclassificationviataxonomies>`
                        * :doc:`Search within Taxonomy </feature/product_feature/mdm/general/searchandexplore/searchwithintaxonomy>`

**Application:**        * This feature is used to classify a product into 2 or more structures or hierarchies. Taxonomies allow a user to have hierarchies in the system.
                          Multiple hierarchies can be applied to a product.
                        * *Example:*

                            A user has created an energy drink product and was given a hierarchy of just *Beverages* under *Food*. The product
                            may also have another hierarchy which can be under *Sports and Energy Drinks*. Multi-taxonomy allows a user to define more than one taxonomy for the product.
