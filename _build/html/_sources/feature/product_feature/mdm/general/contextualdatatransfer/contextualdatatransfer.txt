**Description:**        * Contextual data transfer is concerned with the transmission of data from a parent product to its child products.

**Application:**        * This feature helps to reduce the time and effort needed for providing details in the variants of the product.
                        * *Example:*

                            A fashion retailer wants to create the different size and color variants of the shirt product.
                            Using Contextual Data Transfer, only the details for only parent shirt product are required.
                            Once the retailer provides the details in the parent product, he will be able to transfer all the details in all variant products.
                            Thus, he will not have to manually provide all the details in all variants.
