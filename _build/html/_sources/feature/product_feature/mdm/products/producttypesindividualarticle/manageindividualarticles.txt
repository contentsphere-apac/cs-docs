Manage Individual Articles
==========================
Manage Individual Articles enables you to manage a product at the level of a Single Article. Any attribute, relationship or classification can be managed at the level of an individual Single Article.


===================   =================================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term:**         * **Product Information Management (PIM):** facilitates the central management and maintenance of an enterpriseâ€™s product data, content or any related information.

**Description:**      * A Single Article is a basic unit in Contentserv for a product without variants.
                      * Contentserv allows you to create, edit and delete individual products.

**Related topics:**   * :doc:`Manage Units for Individual Articles </feature/product_feature/mdm/products/unitsandsku/individualarticles>`

**Application:**      * Create a Single Article in the system to represent a single item.
                      * *Example:*

                          Let's say a retailer wants to add a new flavor of Red Bull to their stock.
                          To do that, they need to create this product as a Single Article.
