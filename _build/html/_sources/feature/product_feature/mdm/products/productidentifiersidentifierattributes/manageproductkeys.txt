Manage Product Keys
=====================
Manage Product Keys is a feature that sets up certain attributes as *Product Keys* so that they can be checked for uniqueness and can be used as an identifier.


===================     =======================================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term:**           * **Property:** a data field which describes a product, can also use *'attribute'*.

**Description:**        * Products are created with unique values, which are called *Product Keys*.
                        * Product Keys define attributes to be a unique value. If non-unique values will be used, a violation will appear for the *Product or Article*.

                        * :doc:`Manage Virtual Catalogs </feature/product_feature/mdm/products/catalogmanagementvirtualproductcatalogs/managevirtualcatalogs>`

**Application:**        * A user can define certain attributes to be unique so that the products created by that class are also unique based on that attribute.
                        * *Example:*

                            Supplier A	wants the **GTIN value** of his products to be unique. This can be done by setting the attribute, GTIN, as a *Product Key or Identifier Attribute*.
