Manage Data Transfer
====================
Manage Data Transfer lets you define the inheritance of properties from PIDs to their variants.


===================     =============================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term:**           * **Property:** a data field which describes a product can also use *'attribute*'.

**Description:**        * There are properties that are common to a PID and its variants.
                          Data transfer uses a coupling to push these common properties to the variants directly.

**Related topics:**     * :doc:`Manage PIDs </feature/product_feature/mdm/products/producttypespid/managepids>`

**Application:**        * Manage the information that is common between the PID and its variants, and have such information applied to all variants.
