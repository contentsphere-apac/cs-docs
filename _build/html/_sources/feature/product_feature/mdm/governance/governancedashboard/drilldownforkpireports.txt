**Key Term:**           * **Taxonomy:** a taxonomy is a scheme of classification used for an organizationâ€™s products.

**Description:**        * Different levels can be maintained for the dashboard to dive in the report and get more enhanced review of the report.
                        * A user or supplier can have a detailed view of all the products drilled down in the report that allows a user to explore the quality issues.

**Application:**        * This feature helps the user or supplier to have an in-depth DQ report for all the products available.

                             A KPI for fashion taxonomy is created, it can be drilled down to a sub-level of the fashion taxonomy, and then again,
                             there can be another drill down based on a Color tag, by which the user can have a detailed report and then explore all the KPI.
