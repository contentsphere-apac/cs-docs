KPI-based DQ Reports
=====================
The KPI-based DQ Reports is a data governance feature that allows an administrator set up *KPI-based Data Quality reports* and link it to specific roles which enables the designated users  to take proper corrective actions.


===================     =======================================================================================================================================================================
**Description:**        * Data Quality Reports or Dashboards can be generated for each user/role in the system that shows a brief overview of all the products.
                        * These reports help a user understand the products in the system and show errors in the system (if there are any).
                        * The Data Quality Report gives a role a summary of all the products in the system that enables a user to take proper corrective actions
                          based on the rules applied to the products and the KPI dashboard.

**Related topics:**

**Application:**        * The KPI Dashboard helps a user understand the products better and take actions on the products
                          if they are below certain standards, which have been predefined by the rules set for those products.
                        * *Example:*

                            For a supplier of fashion products, a *Fashion KPI Report* would give an overview of all the fashion products based on a certain rule like completeness of GTIN.
                            Corrective actions can be taken for products violating the rule.
