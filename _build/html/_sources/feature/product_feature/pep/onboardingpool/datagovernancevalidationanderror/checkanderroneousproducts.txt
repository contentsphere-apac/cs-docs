=============================
The Check and Erroneous Products is a feature that can be used by Data Stewards to view all the products, flagged with errors and warnings so that corrective actions can be taken.

**Description:**        * In the *Onboarding Master Catalog*, a Data Steward can see Products transferred by a supplier.
                        * This feature allows an admin to create and apply rules like KPIs for data accuracy in the master catalog.

**Application:**        * The feature can create an **Onboarding Pool**, where a *Data Steward* manages and corrects product data of a supplier.
                        * *Example:*

                             A data steward manages all the product of a supplier. The supplier transfers the products in the master catalog.
                             Then, the data steward can make corrective actions on the data that are flagged with errors and warnings due to
                             the rules that have been applied in the master catalog. The feature will show the conditions that have not been
                             met by the Onboarding data.
