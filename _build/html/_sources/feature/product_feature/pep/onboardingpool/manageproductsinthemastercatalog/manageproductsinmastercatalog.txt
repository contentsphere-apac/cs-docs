                            An organization has a Data Steward who manages all the products in the Master Catalog and there are *Suppliers A and B*, who sell furniture and fashion products.
                            Data Steward gives permission for *Data Integration* to both suppliers.
                            They proceeded with on-boarding of their products and transferring to the Master Catalog,
                            where all the Products are verified and corrected by the Data Steward, if necessary.
