**Key Term:**           * **Product Information Management (PIM):** *(domain type, tabbed heading)* Product Information Management (PIM) facilitates the central management and maintenance of an enterpriseâ€™s product data, content or any related information.

**Description:**        * Master Catalog allows a Data Steward to manage all products at the time of onboarding.
                        * The feature manages all the content of the product before transferring to PIM, and allows the user to make changes in the product content.

                        * *Example:*

                            A retailer, with 5 suppliers, creates a user, *Data Steward* who monitors the data quality of products that are onboarded.
                            The Data Steward allows the suppliers to import their products via *Data Integration* and once the data quality check is passed and completed,
                            the Data Steward will push the products to PIM. These products will now be visible in the Master Catalog.
