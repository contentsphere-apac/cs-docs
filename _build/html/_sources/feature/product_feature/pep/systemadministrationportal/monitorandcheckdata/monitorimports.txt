Monitor Imports
================
The Monitor Imports feature provides an import summary for every import of product data that allows corrective action to be promptly done, if necessary.


===================     =======================================================================================================================================================================
**Description:**        * The user will get a summary of the reports for each completed import process.
                        * The summary includes a report on key indicators of the products being imported, so that the user can check the product violations and may appropriately correct them.

**Application:**        * The user gets an overall summary of the *previous, recent, and/or the total number* of uploaded files.
                          It also provides information about the successful imports and violations.
