Correct Imported Records
=========================
Correct Imported Records is a feature that edits records with incorrect, non-conforming quality, or incomplete data and reprocess them so that the data can pass the quality check of the system.


===================     =======================================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term:**            * **Taxonomy:** A taxonomy is a scheme of classification used for an organizationâ€™s products.

**Description:**        * *Red* violation is a major violation that requires rectifying of errors.
                        * *Orange* and *Yellow* violations are non-major violations but should also be rectified.
                        * *Note: Red violation for the product data means that the data cannot be transferred into the system.
                          Whereas for Orange and Yellow violations, product data can be transferred.*

**Application:**        * One can correct the data quality through violations.
                        * The feature ensures that the mandatory fields are not left empty.
                        * *Example:*

                            Supplier A on-boarded products. If the entered product properties are incomplete, then the *Catalog* will flag them with a *Red Violation*.
                            The supplier will need to correct those records and only then, those records can be pushed to PIM.
