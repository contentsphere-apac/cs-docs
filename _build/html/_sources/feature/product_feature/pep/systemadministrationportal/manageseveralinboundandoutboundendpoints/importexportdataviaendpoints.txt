Import/Export Data via Endpoints
=================================
The Import/Export Data via Endpoints is a feature that provides a *Data Integration* dashboard for a workspace so that data can be imported or exported using the endpoints.

**Key Term:**            * **Endpoint:** *(concept)* Gateway that describes the system, processes and mapping to be used when onboarding or offboarding the products to and from the system.

**Description:**        * The dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of the key indicators in the process or system.
                        * A dashboard for the *Import/Export Endpoints* will showcase all the information regarding the process in a summary.
                          It will show key indicators for the products that are transferred through the process.

**Related topics:**     * *Manage Endpoints for a System*
                        * *Manage System Profile*
                        * *Monitor Data Quality*

**Application:**        * Based on the dashboard, a supplier or user can view any violation that occurred during the import (or export) process.
                          The supplier/user can then take appropriate corrective measures and decisions.
                        * *Example:*

                            The *Import Endpoint* dashboard helps a *Fashion* supplier to import the fashion data into the system.
                            The dashboard will show a summarized report, as well as, a detailed report for the products imported.
                            The dashboard will also give a glimpse of erroneous or incomplete data that can be corrected  by the supplier.
