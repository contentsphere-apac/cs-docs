Configure Article Export Workflow
==================================
Configure Article Export Workflow is a *Partner Engagement Platform* feature that allows a user to create a workflow for exporting of data.


===================     ===================================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term:**           * **Workflow:** a workflow is a business process that is modeled digitally within Contentserv.
                          An example of a workflow being used in Contentserv is a workflow to manage the product lifecycle.

**Description:**        * This feature allows a user to make a data business process workflow for exporting product data from the Contentserv system to a defined output format, like Excel.

**Related topics:**     * :doc:`Manage Outbound Endpoint </feature/product_feature/pep/platformadministration/dataintegrationmanageoutboundendpoint/manageoutboundendpoint>`
                        * :doc:`Export Product Data to Excel </feature/product_feature/mdm/general/simpleexcelbasedexport/exportproductdatatoexcel>`

**Application:**        * To export data, an administrator decides on the export workflow and endpoints of the offboarding process that would facilitate the data export.
                        * *Example:*

                            *Organization A* sells electronics. If a user from Organization A wants to transfer product data from the system to an Excel sheet,
                            the user can make a workflow and endpoint and can select the workflow at the time of offboard.
