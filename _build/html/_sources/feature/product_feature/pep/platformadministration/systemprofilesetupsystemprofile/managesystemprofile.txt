Manage System Profile
======================
Manage System Profile is an admin feature that manages a *System (Organization Profile)* on the *Partner Engagement Platform* so that systems can be used for system integration.


===================     =======================================================================================================================================================================
**Description:**        * An administrator can create profiles for an organization that will contain the selected endpoints (both for on-board/off-board).
                        * A *System* is a profile created for an organization.
                        * These systems will be alloted to the organization that they have been set up for and can be customized for the organization's specific roles.

**Related topics:**     * :doc:`Manage Endpoints for a System </feature/product_feature/pep/platformadministration/systemprofilesetupandmanagesystemspecificdata/manageendpointsforasystem>`
                        * :doc:`Manage Outbound Process </feature/product_feature/pep/platformadministration/dataintegrationmanageoutboundprocess/manageoutboundprocess>`


**Application:**        * An organization can have multiple end-to-end systems like *CRM, ERP,* etc. These systems will have their own inbound and outbound endpoints.
                        * All these systems (along with the endpoints) can be allotted to the organization and can be further customized for the roles of that particular organization.
                          With this, the admin can maintain exclusivity of endpoints for specific roles within the organization.
                        * *Example:*

                            The CRM-concerned roles within the organization can only access the CRM inbound and outbound endpoints.
                            Whereas, the ERP-concerned roles can only access the ERP endpoints.
