**Key Term:**           * **Data Steward:** A data steward is a role within an organization responsible for utilizing an organizationâ€™s data governance processes to ensure suitablity of both content and metadata.

**Description:**        * This feature is used to update or to create products by a supplier.
                        * This import file feature is done through a **talend job**. Note that before the creation of an on-boarding type process, it is needed to configure the talend job.
                        * To update or create products, supplier sends the JSON file through *JMS (Java Message Services)* queue.  This queue is used by suppliers to view the order of on-boarding jobs.
                        * The JSON file is structured that it should contain: **Main Class ID, Product ID,** and all the **Property Collection-related class**.
