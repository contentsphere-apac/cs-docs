Manage Outbound Process
========================
Manage Outbound Process is an admin feature that manages *Outbound Processes* so that data can be evaluated correctly and be transformed into the required output format before exporting.


===================     =======================================================================================================================================================================
**Description:**        * An *Outbound Process* allows the transfer of system data into an Excel sheet.
                        * An *Outbound Process* can be used to export multiple articles in one go.

                        * :doc:`Products </feature/product_feature/mdm/products/index>`

**Application:**        * To export data from the system into an Excel sheet, admin uses an outbound process.
                        * *Example:*

                            *Organization A* sells *Electronics*.
                            If a user wants to transfer and export product data into a sheet, the user will make an outbound process with the desired output.
