Manage Outbound Endpoints
==========================
Manage Outbound Endpoint is an admin feature that manages *Outbound Endpoints* on the *Partner Engagement Platform* so that the endpoint can be used for exporting data.


===================     ===================================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term:**           * **Endpoint:** is a gateway that describes the system, processes and mapping to be used when onboarding or offboarding the products to and from the system.

**Description:**        * Outbound Endpoint allows users to make a data endpoint where the data would be transferred from the system to an export functionality, example, an Excel file.
                        * In *Outbound Endpoint*, an endpoint can have only one process.

                        * :doc:`Sales and Order Units </feature/product_feature/pep/platformadministration/dataintegrationmanageoutboundprocess/manageoutboundprocess>`

**Application:**        * To create data endpoints, administrator decides on the process that would be offboarded.
                        * *Example:*

                            *Organization A* sells electronics. If a user from Organization A wants to transfer product data from the system to the sheet,
                            the user can make an endpoint and selects that endpoint at the time of offboard.
