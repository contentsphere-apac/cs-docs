**Application:**        * This feature is useful for presenting the product in various perspectives so that the customer will know the product better before making a purchase.
                        * *Example:*

                            A retailer selling dog food would add several images (front side, back side and side display) to the main product image so as to give the customer a better and thorough impression of the product. The back-side image often contains important information, such as ingredients, thus helping the customer purchase the appropriate product.
