Concepts
======================

Data Model
----------
Products in the real world can be described in various ways.
In real life we may say a TV has dimensions, colors, and a supplier.
This is all data that relates to the product.
When we say Data Model we are talking about the way we structure this information
so that it accurately reflects reality while also capturing how different entities in Contentserv
(products, images, audio, color) relate to one another.

Classes
---------
Contentserv uses two types of classes: **(1) Nature Class** and **(2) Non-Nature/Attribution Class**.
Classes define the base configurations for products.
Each class that is given to a product allows that product to have a more precise definition.
There are multiple levels of classes that can be used in conjunction to achieve a more refined classification.
The top level of class is Nature Class. This sets up the type of product base to start with.
Nature Classes are customizable in the *Settings* or *Administration*.
