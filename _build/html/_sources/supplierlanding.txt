Key Terms:
==========

* Data Model
    Data model defines the base data structure for products in your system.
    This structure enables you to connect predefined classes or taxonomies with your products to classify them.
    The data model defines products from the highest level of classification, down to individual attributes and properties.

* Classes
    Classes define base configurations for products.
    Each class that is given to a product allows that product to have a more precise definition.
    There are multiple levels of classes that can be used in conjunction.

* Standard Identifier
    Standard Identifier assigns a unique identifier to the Products/Supplier that can be one of the following: GTIN, SKU, Supplier ID, or Supplier Name.
