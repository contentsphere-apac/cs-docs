===================================
Attribution or Non-Nature Classes
===================================

Products that are defined only by a Nature Class are not yet categorized in your PIM. To give a more specific categorization, you can add Attribution Classes.
The added benefit of using one or many Attribution Classes is that they have their own properties that the product will inherit.
For example, a mobile phone product can have a ‘Mobile Attribution Class’ associated with it, which would include properties for screen size, storage, etc.
Every mobile phone product in your system can be given this Attribution Class. Other Attribution Classes, such as Electronics or Computer, can be added to the mobile phone product.

Below are examples of Attribution Classes and potential properties that they may hold. Each class is fully customizable through the Settings backend.
