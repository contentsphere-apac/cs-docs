Configuring the Products
===========================


Why do we configure products
===============================

Products can be configured with classifications to drive a richer data model. Assigning classes allows the products to be defined of their nature and be provided with basic property sets.
Aside from classes, taxonomies can be added to the products so as to enable the inclusion of attributes that
are specific to a particular category, channel or as in the case of minor taxonomies â€” specific property such as material or type.
Hierarchies can also be added to establish a navigation structure that is clear and easy to follow.
