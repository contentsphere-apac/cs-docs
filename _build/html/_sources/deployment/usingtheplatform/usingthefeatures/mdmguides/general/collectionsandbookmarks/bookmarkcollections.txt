Public or Private Bookmarks and Collections
============================================
Public or Private Bookmarks and Collections feature lets you define whether bookmarks and collections are visible to all or only to certain users.


====================    =============================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term:**           * **Bookmark:** a self-updating bookmark that saves the results of a search.

**Description:**        * Public bookmarks are intended for all users of the system.
                        * Only the user who set a bookmark as private can access that bookmark.
                        * A locked icon indicates that a bookmark is a private one.

**Application:**        * Use a private bookmark for securing access to a personal product watchlist.
                        * Share your product watchlist by using a public bookmark.
                        * *Example:*

                            Suppose the marketing team of a company has created a bookmark for a trial - they can make the bookmark as a *Private bookmark*
                            because they don't want to show their bookmark to the other users of the system.
                            On the other hand, if they want to share the bookmark with other users, they can set the bookmark as a *Public bookmark*.
