Manage Permissions
===================
Manage Permissions lets you define what the user can or cannot do.


====================    =============================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term:**           * **Taxonomy:** a taxonomy is a scheme of classification used for an organizationâ€™s products.

**Description:**        * Simply assign the user to the role with the appropriate functions and say goodbye to unnecessary system changes.
                        * Have full control as to who gets to view, edit, and delete the products in the system.

**Related topics:**     * :doc:`Manage View Templates </feature/product_feature/mdm/administration/usersandpermissionsviewtemplates/manageviewtemplates>`

**Application:**        * The user can access only the permitted functions.
                        * *Example:*

                            Let's say you did not allow a certain user to delete products, then that user will not have the delete function.
