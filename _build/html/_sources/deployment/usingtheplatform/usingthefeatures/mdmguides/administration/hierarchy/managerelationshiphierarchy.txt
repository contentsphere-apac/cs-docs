=================================

====================    =============================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term:**           * **Relationships:** a taxonomy is a way of classifying an organizationâ€™s products. A taxonomy is used to add a Product into the broader
                          classification system of a store.
                        * **Taxonomy:** a way of linking entities together from different domains (e.g. *PIM*, *MDM*, *DAM*) as well as within the same domain.

**Description:**        * Based on the relationship between two entities, hierarchies can be set up for classifying related products.

**Related topics:**     * :doc:`Product Classification via Taxonomies </feature/product_feature/mdm/general/multitaxonomyassignment/productclassificationviataxonomies>`

**Application:**        * Easily classify based on the related articles.
                        * Search as to which articles are related.
                        * *Example:*

                            A user wants to view all assets belonging to a particular product in the system.
                            To do this, a hierarchy must be set up for that product.
