==================
Data Quality Rule
==================
The Data Quality Rule feature provides the functionality to create and set rules in the system to ensure the quality of data.


===================     ===============================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term:**           * **Administrator:** a technical specialist who configures a software system.

**Description:**        * This feature allows an administrator to create rules to ensure that data quality is maintained in the system.
                        * This feature allows data quality rules to be customized.
                        * This feature has two main types of rule: *Rule Violation and Normalization*.

                            **Rule Violation:** alerts a user about a violated rule with an error message.
                            **Normalization:** reduces data redundancy and improves the data integrity.

**Application:**        * Data Quality Rule restricts the entry of unacceptable data in the system.
                        * Data Quality Rule reduces the effort in identifying data quality issues in many common information domains.
                        * Data Quality Rule customizes the rules for specific data conditions.
                        * *Example:*

                            An administrator does not want to see blacklisted words (or for these words to be added) in the product information pages (e.g. *Bomb, Suicide, Shit, etc*).
                            In an attribute value (e.g. *Description*), a rule can be customized that will show a notification message
                            if blacklisted words are added in the description field of a product.
