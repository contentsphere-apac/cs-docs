Public/Private Tasks
=====================
The Public/Private Tasks feature allows a user to set a task to either *Public (Shared)* or *Private*.


===================     ===============================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term:**           * **Product Information Management (PIM):** facilitates the central management and maintenance of an enterprise’s product data, content or any related information.

**Description:**        * Tasks are action events created within an article that are intended for a user. In the system, the tasks contain a description of what action should be done.
                          This feature allows a user to set a task to either *Public or Private*:

                              A **Public** task is shared among users.
                              A **Private** task is only for the user who created that task (and other users granted with permission to access the task).

**Application:**        * An administrator can set a task to remind another user of an action that needs to be done on a particular day.
                        * *Example:*

                            An administrator can create a task for a user to create a new variant for a product. An administrator sets it to *Public Mode*.
                            The user assigned to the task can check the things to be completed and their relevant dates using the calendar view.
