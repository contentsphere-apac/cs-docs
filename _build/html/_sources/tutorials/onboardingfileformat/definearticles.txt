Define Articles, Tags, Taxonomy, and Class in an Onboarding File
================================================================


*	All the articles and its attributes, tags, taxonomies, and classes will be listed in a single sheet of an excel file.
*	All the articles will be listed row-wise in a sheet. Each article will have a separate row in a sheet.
*	The sheet will contain the following details of each article column-wise:

====================   =======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Details                Description
====================   =======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
ArticleID          You need to mention the unique identification of each article in this column. There is no restriction on column name/column header, but the column header will be mapped in **Primary Key Column** field in the system
                       while defining the workflow of onboarding process.

Name               You need to mention the name of each article in this column. There is no restriction on column name/column header, but the column header will be mapped in **Name** field in the system while defining the workflow of onboarding process.

Attribute1         You need to define one of the attributes of an article in this column. There is no restriction on column name/column header. It can be any attribute such as *Long Description, Short Description, List Price,* etc.
                       You need to map the column name/column header in the **Attribute** tab of **Data Integration** -> **Mapping section** in the system.
                       *Note: You can define as many attributes as you want in separate columns in a sheet, in a similar manner as we defined Attribute1.*

Tag1               You need to mention one of the tags applied to an article in this column. There is no restriction on column name/column header. It can be any tag like Size, Color, etc.
                       You need to map the column name/column header in Tag tab of **Data Integration** -> **Mapping** section in system. You need to map column name/column header of a sheet with system tag in this section.
                       You also need to map the provided values of tag with sub-tags of system in this section.
                       *Note: You can define as many tags as you want in separate columns in a sheet, in a similar manner as we defined Tag1.*

Taxonomy           You need to define all the taxonomies applied to an article in this column. There is no restriction on column name/column header, but the column header will be mapped in **Taxonomy** field in system while defining the workflow of onboarding process.
                       You need to mention all the applied taxonomies to an article against each article in this column. There can be multiple taxonomies applied to an article like Food, Beverages, etc.
                       You need to define all applied taxonomies to an article in a single cell as a comma separated value. You need to map all defined taxonomies in an onboarding file with system taxonomies in the **Taxonomy** tab of **Data Integration** -> **Mapping section**
                       in the system.

Class ID           You need to define the class of an article in this column such as *Single Article, Loose Bundle, Set of Product, Fixed Bundle,* etc. There is no restriction on column name/column header,
                       but the column header will be mapped in system while defining the onboarding process.
                       Here we need to consider two things: **Single Class** and **Multiple Class**


====================   =======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

====================   =======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Class ID               Description
====================   =======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Single Class       It is possible that all the defined articles in a sheet use the same class. For example, all the defined articles are Single Article.
                       In this case, we need to select **Single Class** option from **Type** field while defining the workflow of onboarding process in system. Select the system class of product from **Class ID** field while defining the workflow of onboarding process.

Multiple Class    It is possible that all the defined articles in a sheet use different classes. For example, some of the defined articles are Single Article and some are Fixed Bundle.
                       In this case, we need to select **Column Class** option from **Type** field while defining the workflow of onboarding process in system. Enter the column name/ column header of a column, where you have defined classes against each article in a sheet,
                       in a Class Column field while defining the workflow of onboarding process in system. You need to map all defined classes in a **Class** tab of **Data Integration** -> **Mapping** section in system.
