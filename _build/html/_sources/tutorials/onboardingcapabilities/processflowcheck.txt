===================
Process Flow Check
===================
Having a process flow feature provides the user a visual representation of the entire onboarding process. Data violations, if any, are depicted in red/orange color. A successful data onboarding process is shown in green color.


Prerequisites
=============
* Configured Partners
* Configured Users


Key Terms
=========
* **Workflow:** a workflow defines the structure and components of a file that is to be imported into the system or exported from the system. It provides all the details of all the components configured in a sheet. The system will interpret the imported file in a way we define the details in the Process section.


How to do a Process Flow Check
===============================

* Log in to the application.

|

* Click on the **Administration** icon.

|

* Navigate to **Data Integration** -> **Workflow** menu.

|
|

* Click on the "+" icon to create the workflow.

|
|

* Enter the details such as *Name*, *Event Type*, and *Code*, then click on the **Create** button.

|
|

* Select the created workflow. On the pop-up window that appears, configure all the components of the workflow.

|
|

* The *Graph* section in the pop-up window is divided into three vertical sections. The first two vertical sections are called *Workflow Modeler*. It allows to configure workflows using BPMN 2.0 modelling notation. This will allow users to model complex onboarding process using universally known and standardized BPMN 2.0 notation. The third vertical section contains the details of each component of onboarding file.

|
|

* Drag and drop the notations in *Workflow Modeler* to define the onboarding process. The workflow starts with the **Start Event**.
   It acts as a process trigger. So, first element in the workflow will be the **Start Event**.

|
|

* Select the **Start Event** notation to show the options for that notation.

|
|

* Start adding the notations to define a workflow according to the onboarding file. For example, if you want to add *Article* in a flow, then click on the **Task** notation.
   Custom actions for different users will be managed through workflow **Task**.

|
|

* Once you clicked on the icon, the task gets added in the flow.

|
|

* Adding the **Task** notation simply defines the task. Click on the **Wrench** icon to define what kind of a task it is, whether it is *import article*, *import asset*, *import relationship*, etc.

|
|

* As soon as you click on the **Wrench** icon, a window appears containing the types of task.

|
|

* If you are defining an article, then select the **Article Import** option from the list.

|
|

* Double-click on the created task icon and enter a name for that icon.

.. image:: /tutorials/_images/cs_processflowcheck_doubleclick.PNG
|
|

* Define the components of the system such as *Assets, Relationships, and Nature Classes*. Create a task, click on the **Wrench** icon to select the type, and enter a name for that task.

|
|

* Once you added all the components in a flow, append the **End Event** notation at the end. It represents the end of flow. Select the last component and click on the **End Event** notation.

|
|

* View the End Event icon appended at the end of flow.

.. image:: /tutorials/_images/cs_processflowcheck_viewendevent.PNG
|
|

* Click on each component and in the third vertical section, fill in the details of each component such as *Sheet Name, Primary Key Column, Type, Class ID/Class Column, Multiclassification, Type, Select Classes/ Class Column Name, Taxonomies*, then click on the **Save** button.
