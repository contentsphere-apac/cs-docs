* Onboarding
    Onboarding is the process of transferring product data from a partner’s system to the main PIM.
    The product details are put together in a file and then uploaded into the retailer’s PIM system. The PIM will fetch the details of the file and validate it with the MDM.

* Offboarding
    The offboarding process allows the user to export product data from Contentserv.
    The data can be downloaded to file or pushed out to channels such as ecommerce.

* User
    The user is someone who logs into the Contentserv system.

* Role
    A role defines the permissions of a user in the system. An organization can have several roles such as Administrator or General User.
    The roles vary between organizations but can be created to match your company.

* Inbound Endpoint
    The Inbound Endpoint is the gateway through which a file is imported into the system.

    Nature Classes could include Single Article, Product, Bundle, or other custom-made product types.
