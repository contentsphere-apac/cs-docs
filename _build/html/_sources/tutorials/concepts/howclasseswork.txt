How Classes work

What is a class?
----------------

Contentserv uses two types of classes: *(1) Nature Class* and *(2) Non-Nature/Attribution Class*.
Classes define the base configurations for products.  Each class that is given to a product allows that product to have a more precise definition.
There are multiple levels of classes that can be used in conjunction to achieve a more refined classification.

The top level of class is *Nature Class*.  This sets up the type of product base to start with.  Nature Classes are customizable in the *Settings or Administration*.
Below are the several default class types:

|

Default Nature Classes
***********************

#. Single Article
    * A stand-alone product which is a sellable item.
    * *Example:*

        Dog Bed (Male/Female color scheme).

#. Product
    * A placeholder for a group of common products.
    * *Examples:*

        (1) Dog Bed.

        |

        (2) Red Bull as the Product, which contains variants like *Regular, Sugarfree, and Zero*.

        |

#. Loose Bundle
    * A group of products where the quantity of each product can be defined by the retailer.
    * *Example:*

        Water Bottle Pack: Buy 10 or more for 15% off.  Each item over 10 can still receive the discount.

#. Fixed Bundle
    * A group of products where the quantity of each product is fixed.
    * *Example:*

        A Shaving Kit Pack includes 3 blades and a shaving cream. As these are in the same packaging, the customer cannot add more blades for that pack purchase.

Attribution Classes
********************
*(Also called Non-Nature Classes)*


Products, defined only by a *Nature Class* are not yet categorized in your PIM.  To give a more specific categorization, you can add *Attribution Classes*.
The added benefit of using one or many Attribution Classes is that they have their own properties that the product will inherit.
For example, a mobile phone product can have a *'Mobile Attribution Class'* associated with it, which would include properties for *screen size, storage*, etc.
Every mobile phone product in your system can be given this Attribution Class.  Other Attribution Classes can be added to the mobile phone example such as *Electronics or Computer*.

Below are examples of Attribution Classes and potential properties that they may hold.  Each class is fully customizable through the *Settings* backend.
