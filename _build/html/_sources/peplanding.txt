Key Terms:
==========

* PEP
    Partner Engagement Platform (PEP) is a portal which allows a Contentserv customer’s partners to engage with their system.
    Deployed for supplier engagement, collaboration, product onboarding, simple PIM and product data onboarding/offboarding.

* Onboarding
    Onboarding is the process of transferring product data from a partner’s system to the main PIM.
    The product details are put together in a file and then uploaded into the retailer’s PIM system.
    The PIM will fetch the details of the file and validate it with the MDM.

* Endpoint
    Endpoint is a gateway that describes the system, processes, and mapping to be used when onboarding or offboarding the products to and from the system.

* Workflow
    Workflow is a sequence of processes that a piece of work progresses through until completion.
    In Contentserv, the piece of work is normally a product.
    The status of the product is also managed through the workflow such as Active, Published, and Inactive.
