Master Data Management
======================

#. The Contextual Multi-Domain MDM seamlessly combines the functionalities of PIM, DAM/MAM
   and MDM systems as well as those of a publishing and editing system in one single solution.
#. All data can be provided for publication on all channels and at all touch-points directly from
   the Contextual Multi-Domain MDM: product information, master data, customer, supplier and location 
   data, etc., marketing content, editorial content and media assets.
#. All content can be displayed automatically in order to ensure an optimum presentation in the specific context.
#. An integrated, powerful On-boarding Portal allows for the efficient integration of data from various
   sources (suppliers, manufacturers, agencies, etc.).
#. An integrated data quality check guarantees that, despite the maximum personalisation of messages
   and product presentation, all information remains consistent at all times.
