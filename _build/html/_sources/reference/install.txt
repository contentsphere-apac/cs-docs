Quick install guide
====================

Before you can use Contentsphere, you'll need to get it installed. We have a
:doc:`Deployment Planning </reference/deploymentplanning>` reference that covers all the
possibilities required in planning the carrying out a complete installation,
including the deployment of the application to a cloud service or on premise.

Install prerequisites
======================

Contentsphere requires a number of prerequisites to be in place including an installed
operating system and hypervisor. Refer to :doc:`Deployment Planning </reference/deploymentplanning>` for the details.
Contentsphere has database dependencies and requires a database to be set up.

|

Set up a database
==================

This step is only necessary if you'd like to work with a "large" database engine
like *PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Oracle*. To install such a database, consult this document,
:ref:`database installation information <database-installation>`.

|

Remove any old versions of Contentsphere
=========================================

If you are upgrading your installation of Contentsphere from a previous version,
you will need to :ref:`uninstall the old Contentsphere version before installing the new
version <removing-old-versions-of-Contentsphere>`.

|

Install Contentsphere
======================

You have three easy options to install Contentsphere:

* :ref:`Install an official release <installing-official-release>`.
  This is the best approach for most users.

* Install a version of Contentsphere :ref:`provided by your operating system
  distribution <installing-distribution-package>`.

* :ref:`Install the latest development version
  <installing-development-version>`. This option is for enthusiasts who want
  the *latest and greatest* features and are not afraid of running a brand new code.
  You might encounter new bugs in the development version but reporting them
  will help the development team of Contentsphere. Also, releases of third-party packages
  are less likely to be compatible with the development version than with the
  latest stable release.

.. admonition:: Always refer to the documentation that corresponds to the
    version of Contentsphere you're using!

    If you do either of the first two steps, keep an eye out for parts of the
    documentation marked **new in development version**. That phrase flags
    features that are only available in development versions of Contentsphere, and
    they likely won't work with an official release.
